    "description": "萨姆·卡布拉尔（Sam Cabral） BBC新闻，华盛顿 15 分钟前 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz） 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz）起初是卡马拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）的潜在副手人选中名不见经传的一位。但随着他在电视节目上的一句“这些人就是怪”走红，他一跃成为民主党副总统候选人。 现年60岁的蒂姆·沃尔兹以接地气、坦率和犀利回应共和党反对派发起的进攻。 他还拥有一份引人注目的履历——在从政前，他曾担任过公立学校教师、美式橄榄球教练和国民警卫队队员。 他曾在国会代表一个倾向共和党的选区，后来又在明尼苏达州州长任上通过了左翼政策。在美国政治两极分化的今天，他的从政经历可能具有广泛的吸引力。 教师、教练和议员 沃尔兹出生于内布拉斯加州乡村，曾在夏天务农和打猎，17岁时加入美国陆军国民警卫队。他在这支志愿部队服役长达24年。 沃尔兹的父亲是一名公立学校行政人员，曾鼓励他参军。19岁时，他的父亲因肺癌去世。 这位明尼苏达州州长曾谈到他的母亲靠社会保障遗属津贴维生，而《美国军人权利法案》帮其支付了大学学费。 凭借教师学位，沃尔兹在1989年“六四”天安门镇压事件发生前后，赴中国担任了一年教师。 后来，他与妻子格温·惠普尔（Gwen Whipple）前往中国度蜜月，还组织美国学生暑期到中国游学。 回到内布拉斯加州家乡后，沃尔兹当上了老师和美式橄榄球教练，直到他的妻子（学校另一名教师）带他回到了明尼苏达州的家乡。他们现在育有两个孩子。 作为曼卡托西高中（Mankato West High School）的教练，沃尔兹帮助学校建立了美式橄榄球项目，并带领学校首次获得州冠军。 他还因同意担任学校同志与非同志联盟的指导老师而赢得赞誉，当时同性恋在很大程度上受到人们的排斥。 他最初在明尼苏达州南部一个以农业为主的地区竞选公职，这个地区非常乡村，倾向于共和党。 但沃尔兹因在竞选中表现得温和及关注公共服务和退伍军人权益而爆冷。 图像来源， Getty Images 2007 年众议院伊拉克投票后，蒂姆·沃尔兹和南希·佩洛西等一众的留影。 观点和信仰 在沃尔兹12年的国会生涯中，很难给他的意识形态贴上标签。 他投票支持《平价医疗法案》，共同发起了包括提高最低工资法案在内的有利于劳工的措施，并支持一项未获成功的减少碳排放的限额交易措施。 但他也找到了与共和党人的共同点。 他投票支持继续为伊拉克和阿富汗战争提供资金，支持对进入美国的难民进行更严格审查，并试图阻止奥巴马时代在2008年金融危机后对银行和汽车公司的救助。 支持拥枪权的全国步枪协会曾为他的竞选活动捐款。但在2018年佛罗里达帕克兰校园枪击案发生后，他公开表示支持禁止攻击性武器，因此失去了该协会的支持。 2018年，沃尔兹在明尼苏达州州长竞选中以超过11个百分点的优势胜出，但他的首个任期因新冠疫情和明尼阿波利斯警察杀害乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）事件而蒙上阴影。 共和党人严厉批评沃尔兹在抗议活动愈演愈烈时，仍迟迟没有部署国民警卫队。 但这名州长赢得了连任。在民主党以一个席位的优势控制着州议会的情况下，他的第二个任期相当忙碌。 该州民主党人将堕胎权奉为圭臬、制定了带薪事假和病假、加强了枪支法、为学校普及免费膳食提供资金，并对经济适用房进行投资。 这一系列紧锣密鼓的活动引起了前总统贝拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）的注意，他写道： “ 如果你需要一个实例证明选举是会产生影响的，看看明尼苏达州正在发生什么。” 图像来源， Getty Images 蒂姆·沃尔兹在从政之前是一名公立学校教师、橄榄球教练和国民警卫队成员。 “这些人都很怪” 沃尔兹在全国范围内知名度并不高，但最近几周，他对共和党人的尖刻描述迅速引起了热议。 “ 另一方都是怪人。 &quot;他最近在美国媒体MSNBC上说出这个频繁使用的标签。 “ 他们想要禁书。 他们想进入你（医生）的检查室。” 但共和党人很快就攻击他在明尼苏达州的所作所为，称其对普通美国人来说过于激进。 美国众议院排名第三的共和党人汤姆·埃默（Tom Emmer）指责沃尔兹试图 “ 把明尼苏达州变成卡马拉·哈里斯的家乡加利福尼亚州。” 但包括劳工领袖在内的盟友认为，沃尔兹可以扩大卡马拉·哈里斯对农村和工人阶级选民的吸引力。 众议院民主党人安吉·克雷格（Angie Craig）正在为连任展开激烈的竞争，她称赞沃尔兹是 “ 久经考验的领导者。” 她告诉BBC，沃尔兹是 “ 公认的赢家，在许多艰难的竞选中从未失败过”，她相信他将是卡马拉·哈里斯的最佳副手人选。",

    "description": "2024年7月29日 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了重要的圣经场景“最后的晚餐”。 巴黎奥运开幕至今，尺度较大的开幕式上若干细节成为遭到热议的话题，在各项赛事开始之后，赛场上也有争议现象出现。国际奥委会、巴黎奥组委甚至已对一些事件进行解释和道歉。 以下是BBC整理的本届奥运会截至目前的几大争议场面，以及其发酵讨论过程。 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 2024年巴黎奥运会有什么独特之处？ 奥组委为开幕式冒犯感“道歉” 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了文艺复兴时期著名画家达芬奇的名画“最后的晚餐”。 这幅名画描绘的是一个重要的圣经场景。 批评者之一法国天主教会（Catholic Church in France）表示，开幕式突出了“嘲弄、蔑视基督教的场景”。 图像来源， EPA 巴黎奥运开幕式上的表演包括演绎一场晚餐，以及模仿希腊神话酒神狄俄尼索斯，引发了批评。 美国电讯公司C Spire表示，在“被开幕式上对最后的晚餐进行的嘲弄震惊”后，正在撤下奥运会的周边广告。 意大利副总理萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）、美国众议院议长约翰逊（Mike Johnson）也提出批评，认为对《最后的晚餐》的嘲弄，令全球基督徒感到震惊及侮辱。 开幕式艺术总监若利（Thomas Jolly）表示，绝没有故意嘲弄或蔑视任何人，存在争议的场景是为了代表异教徒诸神。 “很明显，从来没有故意不尊重任何宗教群体的意图。”巴黎奥组委发言人德尚（Anne Descamps）周日（7月28日）对记者表示。 她说，“与之相反，我认为若利努力歌颂社区包容。我们相信这雄心壮志已经实现，若有任何人感到被冒犯，我们真的非常抱歉。” 若利也对法国媒体表示，“这个创意是为了展示一场和奥林匹斯众神有关的、盛大的多神的派对。” “在我的作品中你看不到嘲笑任何人的意图。我想要的是把人们团结在一起、调和各方的开幕式，同时展现自由、平等、博爱的法国大革命精神。” 错将韩国当朝鲜 国际奥委会道歉 图像来源， Reuters 在韩国代表团乘船参加开幕式时，法语及英语播报员介绍他们时都用的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”（Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea），毫无疑问这正是朝鲜（北韩）的官方名称。 这个名字稍后又被播报，不过这次用对了地方，介绍的是入场的朝鲜代表团。 南北朝鲜自从二战结束后分治，双方的紧张局势近日还有所升温。 不过，电视字幕上提供的名字是正确的。 韩国文化体育观光部随后表示，会就此过失向法国政府进行强烈抗议和投诉。该声明说，对于这一播报表示遗憾，因为韩国代表团被介绍为了朝鲜队。 该国文化体育观光部副部长张美兰（Jang Mi-ran）还要求就此事和国际奥委会主席巴赫进行会谈。 国际奥委会已经在其官方X（前推特）账号里称，“我们要就韩国代表团在开幕式上被错误介绍一事表示深深的道歉。” 前强奸犯参赛被嘘 图像来源， Getty Images 曾经犯下强奸儿童罪的荷兰沙滩排球运动员史蒂文·范德费尔德（Steven van de Velde）首次出现在奥运赛场，收获了掌声和嘘声。 2016年他因强奸一名12岁的英国女孩被判四年监禁。一年后获假释出狱，有犯罪纪录。 他和搭档目前世界排名第10，在埃菲尔铁塔体育场的首秀中败于一对意大利组合。他们将于31日出战下一场比赛。 范德费尔德在比赛前被介绍给观众时，赛场同时出现掌声和嘘声。 在首场比赛前，一份网络请愿呼吁禁止他参加奥运会，这份请愿书获得了9万签名。 有观众对BBC体育说出了自己的观点。 一位英国观众说，“他表现出了开放和诚实……但我个人觉得他们做出了一个艰难的决定。” 另一位英国观众说，“他们应该选择其他人，以避免引起争议。如果这是一个英国人，我可不愿让他出现在我们的队伍中。” 但一位荷兰观众说，范德费尔德参赛是对的，“他已经受到了惩罚，都结束了。他可以像其他人一样继续生活。” 范德费尔德此前接受荷兰媒体采访时说，“我无法改变（观众），因此我必须承受后果。这是我人生中的最大错误。” 国际奥委会表示，运动员的选择权在国家奥委会。 范德费尔德2017年重回赛场，荷兰奥委会说，他已经满足了荷兰排球联合会关于运动员犯罪后重返赛场的标准。",

    "description": "24 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎奥运会的金银铜牌 在巴黎奥运会的拳击和田径两个项目中，夺冠的运动员获得的不仅仅是奖牌。 1896年，现代奥运会在雅典拉开帷幕，当时这是一项严格意义上的业余赛事，既没有职业运动员，也不允许提供奖金。 然而，在今年夏天的巴黎，运动员中既有年收入数亿美元的超级富豪，也有艰难负担比赛费用的参赛者。 奥运选手的收入来源多种多样：赞助商、国家给予的经济奖励，以及本届首次在奥运会上发放的奖金。 由于并非每个项目都有奖金，这一决定引发了争议，即如何最好地分配奥运会带来的财富。 2024巴黎奥运奖牌榜 张家朗、江旻憓巴黎奥运夺金 拆解香港如何成为剑击之城 仅限拳击和田径 图像来源， Getty Images 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德 (Julien Alfred) 在赢得女子 100米冠军后将获得 50,000 美元奖金以及金牌。 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德（​Julien Alfred）在夺得女子100米冠军后，将获得5万美元奖金和金牌。 在2024年巴黎奥运会的32个体育项目中，只有田径和拳击两个项目可以获得奖金。 今年4月，国际田径管理机构世界田联（World Athletics）出人意料地宣布，2024年巴黎奥运会金牌得主将获得5万美元（3.94万英镑）的奖金。 一个月后，国际拳击协会（IBA）表示，该机构也将向奥运冠军发放10万美元（7.87万英镑）的奖金，不过其中四分之一将归运动员所在国的拳击协会所有，另外四分之一归教练所有。 在这两项运动中，银牌和铜牌获得者的奖金较少。而拳击比赛中，排名前五的选手都将获得奖励。 这些奖金并非直接来自奥运会主办方，而是来自这两个项目的管理机构。 世界田联正在使用从国际奥委会（IOC）获得的部分资金，这些资金是奥运会收入的一部分。而这笔钱以前被用于更广泛的运动员培养，有人质疑设立奖金是否是明智之举。 考文垂大学（Coventry University）社会商业中心的汤姆·巴森（Tom Bason）博士专门研究大型体育赛事。他说：“奖金流向获胜者，这或许强化了顶级运动员是有偿（竞技）的事实。” “在田径项目上夺金的人，很可能已经是那些拥有巨额赞助和代言合同的人了。” “其中一种批评声是，这笔钱可以更好地用于培养运动员，把钱花在年轻运动员身上，而不是那些在比赛中名列前茅的人。” 不过，考虑到一些奥运冠军曾陷入经济困境，他们亦能从额外的收入中受益。苏联体操传奇人物奥尔加·科尔布特（Olga Korbut）在其奥运生涯中获得了四枚金牌和两枚银牌。但在2017年，她不得不以33.35万美元的价格出售了自己的三枚奖牌。 拳击比赛奖金的来源则不太清楚。国际奥委会最近断绝了与国际拳击协会的一切联系，理由是后者的运作“缺乏财务透明度。” “与以往国际拳击协会的资金一样，这笔钱的来源尚不清楚。”国际奥委会在一份公开声明中说。 巴森博士补充说：“也许有人会说，国际拳击协会这样做是为了让自己成为奥运会的一部分，并与其保持密切联系。” 民族自豪感 图像来源， Getty Images 运动员在奥运会上获得奖牌后，还有很多其他方式可以获得经济奖励。 许多运动员会因为能登上领奖台，而获得所在国家的奖励。 新加坡被认为是在支付奖金方面最慷慨的地方之一，每位巴黎的金牌得主将获得75万美元的奖金。 东道主法国的奖金为8万欧元（8.7万美元），而摩洛哥运动员的奖金更高，为20万美元。 美国则更少，该国的“黄金行动”（Operation Gold）基金向运动员发放3.75万美元。 英国等国则完全不向奖牌得主提供经济奖励。 取而代之的是，英国国家队在奥运会前会向运动员提供一定数额的资助。被认定有很大机会夺金的选手每年最多可获得2.8万英镑。 虽然这些钱绝非小数目，但与世界上最著名的运动员所能赚取的巨额财富相比，还是相差甚远。 “（参加奥运会的）运动员中，既有像美国篮球队那样拿着高薪的球员，也有靠兼职工作养活自己的运动员。”巴森博士说。 明星的力量 图像来源， Getty Images NBA 巨星NBA 巨星勒布朗·詹姆斯是奥运会上收入最高的运动员之一。 根据《福布斯》发布的年度体育富豪榜，西班牙高尔夫名将乔恩·拉姆（Jon Rahm）是2024年巴黎奥运会收入最高的运动员。据这本财经杂志估计，拉姆去年的收入为2.18亿美元，其中大部分收入来自备受争议的由沙特资助的LIV高尔夫巡回赛。 意料之中的是，收入排名第二的是美国明星篮球运动员勒布朗·詹姆斯（Lebron James）。据信，他的收入为1.28亿美元。 由于高尔夫和篮球在国际上的影响力巨大，参加奥运会可能对拉姆和詹姆斯本已丰厚的收入影响不大。 但对于知名度较低的运动员来说，赢得奖牌可以帮助他们增加收入，这是他们所急需的。 他们通常会在代言合同中写入一项条款，规定如果他们登上领奖台，就可从赞助商那里获得奖金。 这些条款一般都是保密的，但2016年耐克（Nike）和新百伦（New Balance）的一场法律纠纷披露，如果美国长跑选手鲍里斯·贝里安（Boris Berian）在奥运会上夺金，将获得15万美元的奖金。 “我想很多人看到美国顶级运动员或为欧洲球队效力的国际足球运动员，就认为每名运动员都可以动辄每周挣10万、20万美元，但事实远非如此。”巴森博士说。 “有许多运动员都在为生计而挣扎。几年前，澳大利亚曾做过一项研究，他们发现目前在为2032年奥运会进行训练的运动员中，有40%的人都有一份兼职或全职工作。” 即使是在拥有许多世界上最富有的体育明星的美国，许多选手的生活也依然不易。​ 美国奥委会和残奥委会最近的一项研究发现，26.5%的现役运动员年收入低于1.5万美元。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 未来的变化 2024年巴黎奥运会颁发的每枚奖牌上，都有一小块取自埃菲尔铁塔的铁片。 向顶级运动员发放奖金是否是体育协会资金的最佳用途，这一激烈的辩论将继续，很可能会扩大到田径和拳击以外的领域。 “（各运动的）体育协会肯定会面临支付奖金的压力。”巴森博士说。 不过，这可能会给媒体曝光率较低的体育项目带来问题，从而导致资金短缺。 “田径和国际拳击是世界上最受瞩目的两项运动。&quot;巴森博士说。“这两项运动将更容易从赞助和代言中获得额外资金。” “而其他运动项目，比如皮划艇，如果它有支付运动员奖金的压力，可能就不那么容易了。” 2024年巴黎奥运会的冠军们至少可以安慰自己，他们将至少获得一枚金牌。 那金牌价值几何？ 今年的奥运金牌含有505克银和6克金——自1912年以来金牌就不是纯金的——其原始价值为950美元。 但巴黎的奥运冠军们希望，他们的夺金记忆是无价的。",

    "title": "日本股市“黑色星期一”后暴涨 美国经济衰退担忧犹存",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-69247220",
    "description": "22 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 周一日本股市盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”。 日本股市坐上“过山车”——周一（8月5日）暴跌，经历“黑色星期一”，周二则大幅反弹。 本周一，日经225指数跌12.4%，收报31506点，已抹去今年以来所有涨幅。其盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”，收盘跌幅12.4%则是日本股市历史上第二大跌幅。 不仅日本，亚洲股市普遍暴跌，韩国综合指数盘中跌幅一度扩大至10%，为2008年以来最大跌幅，收跌8.77%；台湾股市方面，台湾证交所加权股价指数收跌8.35%，为历史最大单日跌幅，其中台积电领跌大盘，股价跳水9.8%。此外，印度、澳洲、新加坡股指都在不同程度大跌。 到美国开盘时间，股市重挫，尤其是科技股。纳斯达克指数崩跌超过1000点，达6.34％；标普500跌3.65％。 这一轮大跌中，中国A股和香港股市躲过一劫，仅小幅下跌。 周二，日本股市又大幅反弹。开盘后一度涨幅超过10%，收复前一天大部分跌幅。韩国开盘上涨4%，台湾上涨3%。 三点原因导致暴跌 周一暴跌的原因何在？ 穆迪分析（Moody’s Analytics）列出了三点原因： 暴跌很大程度上反映了人们对美国可能走向衰退的担忧； 尽管经济数据不佳且通胀放缓，但日本央行上周三却意外上调了短期政策利率，并表示未来还将上调更多利率，日元因此飙升，而此举削弱了日本制造业的出口竞争力，因此日本股市受到打击尤为严重； 与人工智能相关的科技股也受到冲击，影响了台湾和韩国的股票估值，这些地区的芯片制造商生产了全球大部分用于人工智能应用的高端半导体。 换言之，恐慌情绪的源头来源于美国最近经济数据带来的担忧；日本因为恰好上调利率，导致日元飙升，连锁反应下，受伤尤为严重；而韩国、台湾受到连累，科技股受伤较重，而上述两国股市科技股成分较高，与美日市场关联也大。 上周五，美国公布就业数据，7 月份美国经济新增就业岗位 11.4 万个，低于投资者预期的 17.5 万个。失业率升到三年来最高水平，加重了市场对美国经济衰退的担忧，再加上中东动荡加剧，使市场抛售情绪在周一开盘时爆发。 受伤最终的日本股市更为独特。过去一年半，美联储维持高利率，日本央行则没有跟着升息，而是按兵不动。 因此，日元对美元不断贬值，投资者借机进行大量的套息交易。即投资者以日元进行廉价借贷，以美元或欧元进行高收益投资，同时拿到利息差和投资收益，这种交易蓬勃发展，使日币进一步走低。 对于日本公司而言，也乐于见到这种情况，因为日本企业有大量投资在海外，赚取美元，在日本的财报则用日元结算，使其收益增加，国际投资者在过去一年涌入日本股市，推高市场。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国纽交所交易员 但是，上周日本央行意外加息，将政策利率上调了15个基点。此举让投资者担忧；随着日本加息，日元可能升值，那么规模巨大的套息交易可能难以为继。 本周一，在美国经济预期的低迷情绪下，叠加日本加息的影响，全球投资者开始进行“套利交易逆转”（unwind）的操作，即卖出美元、港币等高利率资产，买回日元。而此前因为利差导致对日企收益的乐观情绪也不复存在，抛售就此展开。 美国经济真的要衰退了吗？ 有这种担忧，来自上周五公布的美国就业数据，7月份创造了11.4万个就业岗位，远低于预期的17.5万个，失业率也升至 4.3%，创下近三年来的新高，这触发了一个被称为“萨姆法则”（Sahm rule）的经济学法则。 该法则以美国经济学家克劳迪娅·萨姆（Claudia Sahm）的名字命名，它指出，如果三个月的平均失业率比过去12个月的最低水平高出半个百分点，那么这个国家就处于经济衰退的初期。 由此测算，美国7月份的失业率有所上升，因此三个月的平均失业率为4.1%。而去年的最低水平为 3.5%，高出0.6%，符合“萨姆法则”中衰退初期的条件。 更令人担忧的是，美国联邦储备委员会上周投票决定不降息。而其他发达经济体的中央银行，包括英格兰银行和欧洲中央银行，最近都降低了利率。 美联储维持利率不变，但其主席鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）称，9 月份降息是可以考虑的。这一表态引起了市场担忧——美联储采取行动的等待期是否太长了。 降息意味着借贷的成本更低，这在理论上应该会对经济起到促进作用。但如果就业数据表明经济已经开始下滑，那么人们就会担心美联储即便降息也为时已晚。 除此之外，还有科技公司及其股价。科技公司的股价长期上涨，部分原因是对人工智能（AI）的乐观情绪。上周，芯片制造巨头英特尔宣布裁员15，000人。与此同时，市场传言称竞争对手英伟达（Nvidia）可能不得不推迟发布新的人工智能芯片。 随之而来的是科技重镇美国纳斯达克指数（Nasdaq）的血洗。纳斯达克指数在几周前创下高点后，周五暴跌 10%。 这助长了整个市场的恐惧因素，而这正是危险所在。如果股市恐慌持续，股价继续暴跌，美联储有可能在9月份的下次会议之前介入，并降低利率。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国马里兰州一个地产项目 凯投宏观（Capital Economics）首席经济学家尼尔·希林（Neil Shearing）认为，“如果市场失调加深并开始威胁到具有系统重要性的机构和/或更广泛的金融稳定”，这种情况就可能发生。 但也有些好消息。“萨姆法则”的提出者本人在周一告诉美国媒体，“我们现在并没有陷入衰退。” 她补充说，“经济衰退并非不可避免，还有很大的降息空间。” 其他人则对就业数据持模棱两可的态度。 “虽然报告很糟糕，但并没有那么糟糕。”希林认为，最近席卷美国的飓风贝里尔可能是造成 7 月份薪资数据疲软的原因之一。其他数据显示劳动力市场正在降温，但并未崩溃。 希林补充说：“解雇人数似乎没有增加。” 而 7 月份平均每周工作时间的小幅下降并不意味着经济衰退， 他说。",

    "description": "33 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 中国官方一封文件称，要实施“网证”，这可能意味着中国网民可能未来要持证上网；此文件一出，即便在信息管理严格的中文互联网上，也引起巨大的反响，包括清华大学教授在内的学者也质疑此举监管过度。 不过，学者和大量网民的反对意见很快在中文社交媒体微博上遭删除。 该文件名为《国家网络身份认证公共服务管理办法（征求意见稿）》，由中国公安部，以及中国政府实施网络监管的主要机构“国家网信办”两部门共同起草。 值得注意的是，虽然该征求意见稿明确，意见建议反馈截止日期为8月25日，但“国家网络身份认证试点版”App已在中国多个手机应用商店上线，用户已可以通过身份核验，获得一张带有“网号”的电子网络身份凭证。同时该App试点应用已涵盖10个政务APP和71个互联网APP，包括淘宝、微信和小红书。 征求意见稿解释，网号，是指与自然人身份信息一一对应，由字母和数字组成、不含身份信息的网络身份符号；网证，是指承载网号及自然人非明文身份信息的网络身份认证凭证。网号、网证可用于在互联网服务及有关部门、行业管理、服务中非明文登记、核验自然人真实身份信息。 征求意见稿说明称，基于国家网络身份认证公共服务，自然人在互联网服务中依法需要登记、核验真实身份信息时，可通过国家网络身份认证APP自愿申领并使用“网号”和“网证”进行非明文登记、核验，无需向互联网平台等提供明文个人身份信息。“由此，可以最大限度减少互联网平台以落实‘实名制’为由超范围采集、留存公民个人信息。” 简而言之，该文件称，通过该系统，用户只需通过政府推出的App进行身份核验，而不需要把关键的个人信息交给淘宝等互联网平台，从而可以减少互联网各平台超范围采集和留存公民的个人信息。 图像来源， PA 反对意见：越权之嫌 对于征求意见期还未过，就已经开始试行。有微博网友称，征询意见的期限还没到就急吼吼地实行了，那还征询什么意见，与政府自己制定的《行政管理法》的法律法规都相冲突。 对于此征求意见稿持反对意见者众多，其中最受关注的是清华大学法学教授劳东燕。她发帖分析称，指出了其中三个问题：缺乏“上位法”，架空“自愿原则”，越权之嫌。 劳东燕称，《办法》的核心意思是准备推行网号与网证制度，但这样的举措不仅蕴含极大的社会风险，而且完全缺乏上位法的依据。《办法》虽提到自愿原则，却未对自愿原则的实现提供基本保障，考虑到自愿原则在中国语境下易于被架空的现实，该原则同样难以为网证制度提供正当依据。她说，保护个人信息只是一种幌子，目的是让社会控制变得常规化和规范化。 “我认为，以部门规章的形式推出网证制度缺乏正当性，明显存在越权之嫌，有必要提交全国人大宪法与法律委员会对《办法》进行合宪性审查。”劳东燕称。 对于上述“自愿原则”被架空的可能，北京大学法学院教授沈岿也提出担忧称，通常在鼓励推广之下，统一“网号”“网证”的使用会越来越普遍、越来越广泛。甚至，不排除实行实名制的网络平台将来直接要求用户使用“网号”“网证”登记，而不给用户选择的机会。 一篇流传颇广但已被删除的评论文章《我担心哪天我的上网证被吊销了》称，“网证”变成了一种白名单制度，即凭证才能上网，被许可后才能上网；它的危险性在于，任何人被处罚或者监管后，可能会吊销“网证”，那么是否就剥夺了个人的上网权利，而且以疫情管控为例，中国监管往往层层加码，那么这种级别的监管，终将“祸国殃民”。 图像来源， Getty Images 官方辩解：减少信息泄露 征求意见稿中有三点设置，似乎为了减少可能的争议：自愿原则、“最小化和必要性原则”、减少信息泄露。 征求意见稿提出，鼓励互联网平台按照自愿原则接入公共服务，用以支持用户使用网号、网证登记、核验用户真实身份信息，依法履行个人信息保护和核验用户真实身份信息的义务。 “最小化和必要性原则”，即公共服务平台处理个人信息不得超出为自然人提供“网号”“网证”相关服务所必需的范围和限度。 减少信息泄露。对于用网号网证通过验证的用户，互联网平台不得要求用户另行提供明文身份信息，法律、行政法规另有规定或者用户同意提供的除外。 中国政法大学副教授朱巍对中国官媒称，国家推出了统一认证的机构、统一的信息存储平台，俗称eID的“网号”“网证”制度，也可以理解成每个人在互联网上也有身份证。在统一的“网证”制度下，单个平台无法获取用户个人信息，能大幅减少信息泄露的风险。在统一的身份认证制度下，对于电信诈骗者可以全网封禁其网证，杜绝其更换平台、手机号复活的机会，有利于打击电信诈骗。 另有自媒体发文辩解称，“为社会公众统一签发‘网号’和‘网证’，实际上不是为了管理公众，而是为了治理平台。以我们现在的网络建设水平，个人的上网痕迹信息，哪怕你是匿名的，其实也被记录、可追踪，网号、网证制度不会强化既有能力。我国实行电话卡实名制已经有十一年了，我们用任何软件都需要手机号注册才能发布内容和评论，发布什么违法言论是会被查到的。我们的个人信息早已被掌握，但只要你遵纪守法，谁会去查你呢？”",

    "title": "BBC专访朝鲜“脱北”外交官李日奎: 金正恩希望特朗普当选美国总统",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69243751",
    "description": "珍妮·麦肯锡（Jean Mackenzie） BBC驻首尔记者 5 分钟前 图像来源， BBC / Hosu Lee 李日奎曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞，于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官。 投奔韩国的前朝鲜外交官李日奎（Ri Il Kyu 音译）认为， 平壤希望特朗普（Donald Trump 川普）当选美国总统。 因为若他重新入主白宫，那将是朝鲜（北韩）“千载难逢的机会”。 这位有着独特地位并了解平壤的外交官曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞。它于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为该国自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官，最近接受了BBC的访问。 今年52岁的李日奎曾经七次面对面与金正恩会面。当他去年与家人从古巴逃亡到首尔时，李日奎接受采访。他当时坦承，自己在平壤第一次见到金正恩时“浑身发抖，紧张不安。” 但之后的每次会面中他发现金正恩总是“微笑，心情愉悦”。 “他常常称赞别人，还会大笑，看起来像是一个普通人！”李日奎告诉BBC。 不过，李日奎又强调称他毫无疑问地认为金正恩会不惜一切代价确保自己的生存，即使这意味着要他杀了2500万朝鲜人民：“他本可以成为一个好人和好爸爸。但将他塑造成神话却使他成为了一个怪物。” 在他首次接受国际广播媒体的采访中，李日奎罕有分享他的观察，以助人们了解到这个世界上最神秘和最专制的国家想要实现的目标。李日奎强调，尽管2019年金正恩与特朗普的会谈破裂，但朝鲜仍然视这位前美国总统为可以就核武器计划与平壤谈判的人物。 朝鲜外交官为何叛逃？经济困难可能是重要原因 普京访朝：中国才是普京与金正恩背后的真正力量 闯入传说中“不存在”的朝鲜地标 历史性会面：特朗普“三八线”握手金正恩 过去，特朗普曾称赞与金正恩的关系是其任期内的一项重要成就，并还曾出了名地表示他们“敬爱对方”并互相写信。就在上个月的一场集会上，特朗普对支持者称，金正恩“想念”他,并希望他重新入主白宫。 据此，李日奎表示平壤希望利用这一亲密的个人关系来谋取利益，虽然这与平壤上月发表的一份官方声明相矛盾。该声明称朝鲜“不在乎谁当选美国总统。” 他又对BBC特别提到，称这个拥核国家永不会放弃核武，并可能寻求达成一项协议以冻结其核计划作为换取美国解除制裁之条件。但他补充称平壤不会真诚地进行谈判，而平壤同意冻结其核计划“是一个诡计，百分之百的欺骗”，与平壤在核武谈判是一种“危险的做法”,只会“协助朝鲜更强”。 图像来源， Handout 2019年特朗普跨越三八线的历史性时刻 “生死赌注” 在叛逃8个月后，李日奎现在与家人一起生活在韩国。在韩国警察保镖和两名情报人员的陪同下，他解释了自己决定背弃平壤之原因。 他表示，在朝鲜多年的生活要面对腐败、贿赂和缺乏自由。最后的导火线是他的颈椎滑脱需要动手术，但申请后被拒绝了。“我在朝鲜享有顶层阶级1%的生活，但那仍比韩国中产阶级家庭的生活还要糟糕。” 作为朝鲜在古巴的外交官，李日奎说他每月只赚500美元，因此他非法在中国贩售古巴雪茄来维持家计。当他最初告诉妻子想要逃亡的念头时，妻子吓得心脏出现问题，进了医院。之后他只在飞机起飞前6小时告诉妻子和孩子他的逃亡计划。他形容这是一次“生死赌注”。 在朝鲜，被抓的脱北者，如果是平民通常会被审问数月后获释。但对于像他这样的精英人士来说只有两种结局：被关进政治犯集中营或枪决。“担忧和恐惧让人无法承受。我可以接受自己的死，但我无法承受家人被拖进劳改营的想法！”他说。 李日奎称，尽管他从未相信上帝，但在机场门口焦急等待时他还是开始祈祷。 2016年以来，平壤最有名的高级别叛逃者是太永浩（Tae Yong-ho），他曾是朝鲜助英国副大使，最近被任命为韩国总统顾问委员会下“统一事务委员会”的新任主席。 谈到朝鲜最近与俄罗斯的更紧密关系，李日奎又说，乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料，甚至可能还有军事技术。他强调，这笔交易对平壤最主要的好处是能够继续发展其核武器。他还解释说，俄罗斯通过这笔交易制造了一个“漏洞”（loophole）使得金正恩能够“自由发展其核武器和导弹，加强其军事防御的同时无需向美国请求缓解制裁”。 图像来源， EPA 李日奎说乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料甚至可能还有军事技术。 但他表示，事实上金正恩明白与莫斯科的这种关系是暂时的。乌克兰战争结束后，俄罗斯很可能会断绝这种关系。因此，金正恩并未放弃与美国正常化关系的计划。 “朝鲜明白其生存的唯一道路，亦即消除遭受入侵的威胁、发展经济的唯一方式就是与美国关系正常化。” 虽然俄罗斯可能协助朝鲜暂时缓解了经济痛苦。但李日奎表示，在新冠大流行期间完全封闭国境“严重破坏了该国的经济和人民生活。”当2023年边境重新开放，朝鲜外交官准备回国时，李先生称，家人们要求他们“带回任何和所有你拥有的东西，甚至是你的旧牙刷！因为朝鲜一无所有了。” 金正恩要求其公民绝对忠诚，哪怕是一丝丝反对的气息也可能导致入狱。 但他强调，多年的痛苦生活已经侵蚀了朝鲜人的忠诚。因为，现在没有人再指望从最高领导人金正恩那里得到任何东西：“对政权或金正恩的忠诚不再是真的。那是被迫的忠诚，因为要不是忠诚，就是面临死亡。” “最邪恶的行为” 朝鲜最近的变化，主要是由于大量走私进入朝鲜的韩国电影、电视剧和音乐。这在朝鲜是非法的。据此，李日奎表示“朝鲜人观看韩国文化内容不是因为有资本主义信仰，而只是试图在单调而灰暗的生活中打发时间。但随后人们会问：“为什么南方人过着第一世界国家的生活，而我们却生活在贫苦之中?” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 脱北者讲述他们在朝鲜的生活 不过，李先生说，南韩文化产品正在改变朝鲜，但由于现有的控制系统，这些产品不可能导致朝鲜政权崩溃。“金正恩非常清楚，人民忠诚度正在下降，人们正在改变，这就是为什么他加强了恐怖统治的力度。” 平壤颁布了更严酷的法律用以惩罚那些消费和传播韩国文化商品的人。BBC去年采访了一名脱北者，他表示目睹有人因分享韩国音乐和电视节目而被处死。李日奎说，朝鲜去年年底放弃了数十年的最终与韩国统一的政策，这是进一步将朝鲜人民与韩国隔离的一次尝试。 李日奎将此描述为金正恩的“最邪恶的行为。”因为，所有朝鲜人都梦想着统一。他又向BBC解释说，,尽管过去的朝鲜领导人“偷走了人们的自由、金钱和人权”但金正恩却抢走了他们所剩不多的东西：希望。 在朝鲜之外，人们高度关注金正恩的健康状况。有人认为他可能过早去世，而这也许会导致政权的崩溃。 上一周，韩国情报机构估计金正恩的体重达140公斤，并面临心血管疾病的风险。但李日奎认为，朝鲜的监视和控制的系统已经建立得很牢固，以至于金正恩即便去世也不会危及这个专制政权。“会有另一个邪恶的领导者取代他的位置。” 还有人普遍猜测金正恩正在培养他年轻的女儿（据称名为金珠爱）作为他的继承人。但李先生驳斥了这种说法。他说，金氏家族用来证明其统治正当性是来自“神圣的白头山血统”，而且这被认为只能通过家族中的男性传承。因此，金珠爱缺乏成为朝鲜领导人的合法性和人气。他又说，起初人们对金珠爱很感兴趣，但现在已不再如此了。人民质疑她为什么要参加导弹试验而不是上学，为什么要穿奢侈的品牌服装而不是像其他孩子一样穿学校制服。 图像来源， Reuters 2019年特朗普与朝鲜领导人金正恩的历史性握手 李日奎认为，国际社会不应等待金正恩生病或死亡，而是要团结起来。包括朝鲜的盟友中国和俄罗斯“持续劝说平壤改变。” 他补充说这是唯一能结束朝鲜专制的方法。 最后，他说，希望他的叛逃能激励同伴，不是要他们也脱北，而是要他们从内部推动小的改变。他说，他并没有什么大的期望，比如朝鲜人能够投票或自由旅行。他只是希望人民能选择自己的工作，有足够的食物吃并能在朋友间自由地表达自己的言论。 不过，目前李日奎的优先事项是帮助家人适应在韩国的新生活，让孩子融入社会。 在采访结束时，他向我提出了一个假设情境说：“假如我提供你一个机会，如果成功我们会大赚一笔但失败就得死。你不会同意加入这个计划吧？这就是我强加在我妻儿身上的选择，而他们默默地同意并跟随我。” “这是一笔我必须终生偿还的债。” BBC韩语组权赫（Jake Kwon）和李浩水（Hosu Lee ）共同参与了此报导。",

    "description": "阿格尼娅（Aghnia Adzkia）, 武珍（Tran Vo） BBC国际部 56 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 自去年中柬“金龙”联合军演以来，柬埔寨的云壤海军基地迅速发展，并且有两艘疑似中国“江岛级”护卫舰的船只在此驻扎七个月，这引发了对该地区稳定的担忧。 根据BBC在军事专家的帮助下对BlackSky公司的实时卫星图像的分析，几乎整个190英亩的区域现在都被建筑物、道路和码头占据，仅有约8%的区域被树木或草地覆盖，而两年前这里绿色区域占了一半。 时任中国驻柬埔寨大使王文天在2022年6月举行的开工仪式上确认。中国“援助”了云壤海军基地升级改造项目。 中国官宣柬埔寨云壤海军基地“升级改造” 时间线与战略意义 两名军事专家对BBC称，卫星图片上两艘停靠在这里的护卫舰看起来像是中国护卫舰。 “它们是‘江岛级’护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11、14米，”一位要求匿名的军事情报分析师对BBC表示。 自2023年12月至2024年6月，这两艘船只一直在此停泊，比战略与国际研究中心（CSIS）早些时候记录的5个月时间更长。 战略与国际研究中心东南亚项目主任格雷戈里·B·波林（Gregory B Poling）表示，云壤基地将裨益中方。 “云壤基地的雷达跟踪系统可以帮助中国人民解放军在马六甲海峡和印太地区的行动，”波林在接受BBC采访时说。 在冲突情况下，该基地可以支持燃料补给、弹药和部署。 专家表示，如果中国护卫舰在基地的隐秘访问和隐藏任务继续下去，可能会引发“灾难性失败”。 位于柬埔寨西南的云壤海军基地距离新加坡只有1000公里。该基地位于重要战略位置，它靠近泰国湾的入口以及柬埔寨政府计划建设的该国最大运河的深水港西哈努克市。该基地还靠近马六甲海峡——国际航运路线的咽喉要道。 图像来源， Getty Images 地理位置示意图 基地的迅速扩建 柬埔寨雲壤海軍基地2022年以來的變化 2022年6月18日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 根据BlackSky给BBC提供的卫星图像分析，从2022年6月到2024年6月，两年内这里已经建成了14座大型建筑、一座码头和一片填海区域。 随着建设速度的加快，专家们认为中国帮助了柬埔寨政府。 “如果没有中国在资金、物流和建筑专业知识方面的大力援助，柬埔寨政府不可能建成这些设施，”朱拉隆功大学政治学与国际关系教授提提南·蓬苏迪拉克（Thitinan Pongsudhirak）对BBC表示。 “云壤使柬埔寨更加靠近中国主导东南亚大陆的轨道。因此，云壤将使柬埔寨在东盟成员国中坚定地成为中国的座上宾。” 他还认为，云壤基地似乎“违反了柬埔寨宪法中关于禁止建立外国军事基地的规定”。 前美国海军军官、美国新安全中心高级研究员托马斯·H·舒加特三世（Thomas H. Shugart III）也持有同样的看法，他表示，中国给予了柬埔寨的海军基地全力支持。 托马斯对BBC说：“我认为这是中国建造的，因为这些建筑让我想起我在中国海外基地吉布提和东南亚人工岛上看到的建筑。以目前的建设速度和规模，柬埔寨没有足够的能力完成。” 托马斯指出，云壤西部新建码头看起来与中国人民解放军在非洲吉布提的保障基地码头相似。 中国人民解放军驻吉布提保障基地和柬埔寨云壤海军基地对比图 “关于基地的其余部分，据传，属于中国部分的规模也与中国人民解放军在吉布提的基地规模大致相当，”托马斯补充说。 观察：中国在吉布提设军事基地干什么？ 然而，托马斯指出，他没有足够的证据向中国政府证实他的分析，因为这些只是通过卫星图像得出的。 BBC已联系中国国防部、中国外交部和柬埔寨国防部进行评论，但尚未收到任何回复。 然而，在其它地方，中国和柬埔寨均否认云壤是中国专用的海军基地。 根据中国大使王文天在奠基仪式上的讲话，中国对云壤海军基地升级项目的援助“符合两国国内法律、相关国际法律和国际惯例，不针对任何第三方”。 “中国军队将继续向柬埔寨军队提供力所能及的援助，促进两国军事合作的不断推进，达到新的水平和新进展。” 柬埔寨当地媒体表示，允许外国长年在其领土上建立基地违反了柬埔寨宪法第53条。但柬埔寨前总理洪森和其长子、现任总理洪玛奈一直向当地媒体否认这一说法。 柬埔寨宪法第53条禁止外国在其领土上建立军事基地。 第55条还规定，条约或协议应保障柬埔寨的独立、主权、领土完整、中立性和国家统一。 BBC对基地的五个区域进行的观察发现：北部、中部、东部、东南部和南部每个区域都呈现出快速扩建的趋势 。 云壤基地新建筑群 在东部，从2022年6月到12月仅仅六个月的时间，柬埔寨政府清理了大约24英亩的土地，并开始堆放一些混凝土。一年后，已经建起了四栋大楼。 托马斯认为“这可能是营房（右边两栋）或行政建筑（左边两栋），中间有一个运动场，旁边的两栋直角形建筑似乎是停车场或车辆存储地/车库”。 2023年8月到12月期间，在同一区域他们还建造了四个油罐，然后在2024年4月底将它们涂成蓝色。 在基地的中部，他们从2023年3月开始建造一个新的码头，并于2023年10月完工。两个月后，上述两艘船只停靠在码头上，至少停留了七个月，直到2024年6月。 柬埔寨政府拆除了云壤海军基地北部的旧建筑 他们从东北部开始清理土地。自2022年6月以来的大约两年时间里，他们已经建起了四栋大楼、四栋小楼和一些未知设施。 从2024年2月到6月，柬方似乎在沿海地区拆除旧建筑，并计划建造其他建筑。他们还开辟一些新路径。 大规模整理土地并在云壤海军基地南面新建一座码头 2023年10月，他们在南部清理了一些土地，随后几个月进行了填海造地工作。一年后，混凝土被铺设在那里，一些驳船似乎在新建的码头处进行着什么工作。托马斯说：“可能是运送建筑材料或其他东西来回穿梭。”2024年6月，卫星图像显示出一个新的U形码头。 在东南部，一片清理过的土地上共建起了六栋建筑。随着建筑的扩建，新修的道路清晰可见。小楼扩建旁边还有一些小的单元。 “正在建造的东西与2019年 泄露给媒体的谅解备忘录 (MOU)显示了相似之处。借助中国的技术基础设施和工人，基地面积的三分之一将用于柬埔寨海军，基地北部的三分之二将留给中国独家使用，”波林说。 “他们希望我们关注基地的南部那三分之一，并忽略北部保留为中国独家使用的其余三分之二。” “中国军人可能驻扎在基地” 疑似中国军舰在该基地停留数月引发争议。波林告诉《日经新闻》称，有可能这些护卫舰搭载了士兵进行“轮换或长期驻扎”。 “这意味着在过去的五个月里可能有中国士兵驻扎在这个基地。” 上述匿名军事情报分析员告诉BBC，两艘中国江岛级护卫舰于2023年12月1日首次停靠在云壤，和亚洲自由电台（Radio Free Asia）报道的他们在2023年12月3日抵达参加军事联合演习比起来要更早两天。 2023年12月1日至2024年5月19日，这两艘护卫舰只离开云壤三次，它们总是成对移动，“在任何时候都不会有一艘船在场而另一艘不在”。 2024年6月12日，尽管中国和柬埔寨联合演习已于2024年5月底结束，这些军舰仍停留在那里。 “这些是江岛级护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11.14米，”该分析员告诉BBC。 2023年12月初，柬埔寨国防部长在其 脸书帖子 上确认，这些船只帮助柬埔寨海军准备联合军事训练。然而，在5月的联合军演结束后，它们似乎待了更长时间。 江岛级护卫舰 根据《高棉时报》的 报道 ，早在2020年，即这些护卫舰出现之前，柬埔寨前总理洪森就有承诺，柬埔寨政府将允许所有军舰停靠新建的现代化海军云壤基地。 “关于对云壤基地的使用权，我想声明，我们欢迎来自所有国家的船只，包括美国、法国、加拿大、印度、英国、日本、澳大利亚，而不仅仅是中国，来港口停靠或与柬埔寨共同参加演习。声称柬埔寨已经授予中国50至90年独家使用权这一说法毫无根据。” 然而，就近期中国对该基地的独家使用权问题，值得注意的是根据《高棉时报》报道，2024年2月，两艘日本海上自卫队的驱逐舰在西哈努克港、而不是云壤基地的自主港口停靠了2天。 2023年12月到2024年6月雲壤基地出現中國江島級輕護衛艦 2023年12月1日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 为什么中国的存在对其他国家发出了警告？ 根据美国国防部丹尼尔·K·伊诺耶亚太安全研究中心（Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies of the US Department of Defense）的亚历山大·L·维文教授（Alexander L Vuving）的说法，通过在西部的云壤基地和东部的南沙群岛掌握双向通道，也就是在中国南部海域的纷争岛之间，中国可以完全控制一个非常广阔的区域，包括整个东南亚地区的中心。 “也就是说有了一个可以实时观测监控当下发生的所有事情的雷达，更别提还有一个基地来指挥船只和车辆来控制领空、海域或附近地区了。这也是一种可能性，”维文说。 中国解放军筹划打造“全球后勤补给网”令五角大楼担忧 中国一直在南海实施灰色地带战术——这是军事术语，指的是在战争和和平之间周旋的策略，在不实施武装力量的情况下实现在当地的利益最大化。 “南海冲突不符合中国的利益。如果发生南海冲突，美国可能会作为菲律宾的盟国介入，那么对中国来说事情将变得非常棘手。”维文补充道。 美国军队在菲律宾有外国军事基地。现在随着中国在云壤基地的存在，中国可以部署民兵、军力并拦截信息。 与此观点相同，东亚政治分析师、昆士兰大学讲师艾哈迈德·乌马尔（Ahmad Umar）表示，中国在该基地的存在可能激怒其它邻国。 “首先，中国可以干扰卫星传输消息，其次，这可能破坏该地区的稳定，无法和平解决南海冲突。这也可能引发灾难性后果，不仅威胁到地区的稳定，也威胁到中美关系甚至台湾冲突。”乌马尔告诉BBC。 乌马尔认为，中国决定不将云壤宣布为其海军基地是一种军事战略，目的是阻止美国在中台冲突爆发时支持台湾。 一种转变：从美国到中国 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 在中国获得使用基地的权利很久以前，美国一直是柬埔寨军方的积极合作伙伴。自2010年以来，美国在军事设施的北部资助了两栋建筑，并与柬埔寨共同进行军事训练。 然而在2017年，就在两国联合协作的年度训练之前，柬埔寨突然宣布暂停这项已经持续多年的合作。 2019年，有关中国和柬埔寨关于云壤基地的协议文件被泄露给媒体，并被《华尔街日报》报道。根据文件，柬埔寨允许中国军队使用该基地北半部长达30年，并在此期满后自动续约。 2020年，日经亚洲报道称，一栋由美国资助的建筑被拆除，为中国的新建设让路。 2021年6月，美国副国务卿温迪·谢尔曼（Wendy Sherman）在访问柬埔寨时，他对中国军方的存在、美国资助建筑被强拆以及在云壤海军基地设施的情况表示高度担忧。 在美国政府网站上的一份声明中，谢尔曼表示，“中华人民共和国在柬埔寨设立军事基地将损害柬埔寨的主权，威胁地区安全，并对美柬关系产生负面影响。” 在会议之后，美国国防武官马库斯·M·费拉拉上校（Marcus M. Ferrara）被邀请到基地。然而，他没有完全访问权。对此，柬埔寨政府发言人菲·西潘（Phay Siphan）回应称，他们可以基于国家安全和领土完整的理由限制访问。 “问题在于柬埔寨的行动缺乏透明度。没有人知道哪些区域是为中国保留的，因为柬埔寨和中国都没有宣布。尽管柬埔寨方面总是说他们永远不会让外国在他们的国家建立军事基地，但关于这一点的真相是未知的，”维文在接受BBC采访时表示。 来自柬埔寨未来论坛的研究员安诚波（Chhengpor Aun）告诉BBC：“这种情况（柬埔寨承接外国海军基地）将需要柬埔寨宪法的改变，这可能会引起国内和国际的强烈反对。我不认为柬埔寨政府会冒这个风险，但我无法推测整个大背景下可能会存在的其他安排。” “如果成功升级和适当部署，云壤将在柬埔寨海军防御中发挥核心作用，以加强对泰国湾的海上主权，并为该国对海上安全日益积极的贡献提供支持。” 经过两年的快速发展，中国和柬埔寨一直在积极利用这一基地进行联合军事演习——在六个月内进行了两次。 根据柬埔寨国防部，最近的演习涉及2075名士兵和武器，包括来自柬埔寨的1315名士兵和中国武装部队的760名士兵。 中国和柬埔寨的关系越来越紧密。波林怀疑柬埔寨政府邀请中国到基地的隐藏议程是由腐败政府推动的。 “柬埔寨越来越倾向于中国这一现实源于柬埔寨人民党（CPP）领导的政权，现在洪玛奈基本上正在实行盗窃统治——他们正在寻找赞助商，需要资金来维持体系。如果资金耗尽，该党将崩溃，”波林对BBC说。 “中国是他们唯一可以赚钱的地方。只要中国继续向柬埔寨注入资金，不管洪森、洪玛奈喜欢与否，他们别无选择，只能继续成为北京的客户。” 然而，他补充道：“这并不意味着柬埔寨将永远被中国逼入困境。我认为柬埔寨人民越来越怀疑中国，并将中国视为腐败之源。” “因此，只有在洪森和洪玛奈掌权期间，这个网络才能生存下去。” 制图：Aghnia Adzkia, Andro Saini, Arvin Supriyadi and Ayu Idjaja",

    "description": "5 分钟前 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 中华台北队女拳手林郁婷 在巴黎奥运，女子拳击选手接连陷入性别争议风波，包括阿尔及利亚代表凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）及来自台湾的林郁婷。 她们去年曾遭国际拳击协会（IBA）取消资格，理由是未能通过性别测试，指她们有XY染色体。但国际奥委会（IOC）称，国际拳击协会作出相关决定时，没有任何正当程序。 国际奥委会主席巴赫（Thomas Bach）公開为两名选手辩护，呼吁停止仇恨言论。 “我们有两位拳击手，她们作为女性出生，作为女性成长，拥有女性护照，并作为女性参加了多年的比赛。”他説。“这就是女性的明确定义。她们作为女性的身份从未有过任何疑问。” 乔安娜·哈珀：运动员、科学家和致力保障女子体育的跨性别者 东京奥运：位于话题中心的跨性别举重选手哈伯德 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 赛场上发生什麽？ 28岁的台湾（以中华台北队名义参赛）拳击手林郁婷，周四（8月2日）在其首场奥运比赛中胜出。 她在欢呼声中进入赛场，并於女子57公斤级8强赛事赢了乌兹别克选手图尔迪别科娃（Sitora Turdibekova），现场传出一些嘘声。 图像来源， Ueslei Marcelino/REUTERS 这场赛事打满了三个回合，两人打完短暂握手，但在五名裁判一致判定林郁婷获胜后，她们没有再握手。 图尔迪贝科娃流泪离开赛场，没有停下来接受媒体采访，和她的团队迅速离开赛场。林郁婷则短暂停留，没有回答问题。 台湾媒体引述林郁婷的教练曾自强表示，希望林郁婷不要受外界打扰，不走进采访区，“外国媒体想问相关问题，她不知怎麽回答，有点吓到了”。 此前，阿尔及利亚选手凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）在女子66公斤16强赛事，赢了意大利选手卡里尼（Angela Carini）。 图像来源， YAHYA ARHAB/EPA-EFE 後者在比赛第46秒时宣布弃赛，她拒绝与对手握手，在赛场上跪地落泪，赛後表示“我必须保住自己的生命”。 但卡里尼翌日向对手道歉，称“如果国际奥委会说她可以比赛，我尊重这个决定”。 国际拳协与国际奥委会之争 这次性别风波背後，是国际拳击协会（IBA）与国际奥委会（IOC）之争。 去年3月，有俄罗斯背景的国际拳协在世界锦标赛称林郁婷和凯莉芙“不符合规则”，取消她们的资格。林郁婷的铜牌因此被剥夺。 国际拳协当时称，此举是“为了维护比赛的公平性和最高诚信度”。俄籍主席克里姆列夫（Umar Kremlev）对俄罗斯媒体表示，该会发现有关运动员有XY染色体。 但该判决引发外界质疑，国际拳协进行了“单独且公认的测试”，但一直没有说明是哪种测试，也没有让她们接受睾固酮素检查──睾固酮是男女都有的性激素，而成年男性的睾固酮水平约是成年女性的10到20倍。 到了去年6月，国际拳协因管理不善、贪污等指控，被国际奥委会取消其世界认可地位，奥运拳击赛事改为由国际奥委会自行主持。 不过，国际奥委会上周仍在其网站仍一度引述国际拳协对林郁婷的性别质疑，几天之后才删除相关内容。 上周初，国际奥委会在其媒体信息门户网站上表示，林未能通过“基于生化测试结果的资格要求”。该网站还提到：“这是自国际拳协开始使用新测试方法以来，首次有中华台北运动员被要求进行性别资格的生化测试。” 然而，国际奥委会在几天之后删除了这些信息。 国际奥委会在周四的一份声明中表示，凯莉芙和林成为了“国际拳协突如其来且武断决定的受害者”。 声明指出：“在2023年国际拳协世界锦标赛接近尾声时，他们在没有任何正当程序的情况下突然被取消资格。” “根据国际拳协网站上的会议记录，这一决定最初是由国际拳协秘书长和行政总裁单独做出的。国际拳协董事会仅在事后才批准了该决定，并随后要求在未来类似情况中制定和反映在国际拳协规章中的程序。记录还指出，国际拳协应该‘建立一个明确的性别测试程序’。 “对这两名运动员的当前攻击完全基于这一武断的决定，这一决定是在没有任何正当程序的情况下做出的，尤其是考虑到这些运动员已经参加高水平比赛多年。 “这种做法违反了良好治理原则。” 国际奥委会是根据运动员护照来定义性别。在争议声中，国际奥委会主席巴赫8月3日为两位拳手辩护，表示从没怀疑两人是女性。 图像来源， Carlos Perez Gallardo/REUTERS 巴赫说现在看到的是，有些人想要拥有女性的定义。“我只能请他们提出一个基于科学、新的女性定义。为什么一个出生、成长、参加比赛并拥有女性护照的人不能被视为女性？” 他强调国际奥委会愿意倾听，愿意调查，“但我们不会参与出于政治动机的文化战争”，又指社交媒体上一切“仇恨言论”和政治动机引发的辱骂完全不可接受。 一些台湾媒体去年报道称，林郁婷未通过测试是由于“体重控制和月经周期”药物影响了荷尔蒙水平。 “我男变女，喜欢女生，一点不柔弱”：专访香港罕有跨性别武术家 林郁婷是谁？ 28岁的林郁婷身高175厘米，至今取得40胜14负，曾三次获得世锦赛奖牌，两次获得亚洲冠军。 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 台湾媒体报道，林郁婷1995年出生於新北莺歌，小时候和哥哥一起观看日本知名拳击动漫《第一神拳》，主角幕之内一步本来是性格懦弱、受霸凌的高中生，後来转变成为职业拳王。林郁婷受啓发，从练田径转为练拳击。 而她的教练曾自强曾经透露， 林出身於家暴家庭，她希望保护母亲而学习拳击。 她留短头发、打扮中性，去年被国际拳协剥夺铜牌后曾形容，自己好像岳飞被冠上了莫须有罪名。 “我参与这个协会的比赛那麽多次，光世锦赛就七次，怎麽只有这次说我有问题。不能因为我的长相打扮不同於传统女性的样貌，就这样对我。他们也没有公布检测过程，直接给出一张纸就说结果不符合，这就是违反流程的事。” 凯莉芙是谁？ 25岁的凯莉芙身高178厘米，从2018年开始参加比赛，以9胜5负的战绩进入巴黎赛。 她上届在东京首次参加奥运会，在八强赛事中输给爱尔兰选手哈灵顿（Kellie Harrington），当时她并没有被质疑性别。 去年她进入新德里的世锦赛决赛，但开赛前一天被主办方取消资格。 图像来源， Ramzi Boudina/REUTERS 凯莉芙父亲 这次在巴黎奥运再被质疑性别，凯莉芙的父亲对天空新闻表示：“我的孩子是个女孩。” “她从小就被当作女孩养大。她是一个坚强的女孩。我教育她要勤奋勇敢。她有很强的工作和训练意志。” 他向路透社表示，女儿从六岁起就热爱体育运动，以女儿为荣，并展示凯莉芙的出生证明文件说：“这是我们家的官方文件，1999 年5月2日，伊曼-凯莉芙，女。这里写着，你可以看一下，这份文件不会说谎。”",

    "description": "李澄欣 BBC中文记者 30 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 江旻憓（左）的教练是罗马尼亚的塔维（右）。 香港剑击队在巴黎奥运三天内夺两金，30岁的江旻憓先反胜东道主法国选手在女子重剑（Épée）封后，紧跟着27岁的张家朗卫冕男子花剑（Foil）金牌，成为68年来该项目卫冕第一人。 根据国际剑击联会（FIE）最新排名，香港运动员占据两个单项排名世界第一——江旻憓以总分262分保持女子世界一姐地位，张家朗则以252分重返男子世界第一。 香港人口仅700多万，却能持续出现世界一流剑手，站稳世界顶尖队伍之位。圈内人士称，全港习剑人数保守估计多达2万人，主要来自大中小学校队以及香港剑击总会旗下近50间私人剑校。 BBC中文采访多名剑击队运动员、教练和学者，拆解香港剑击运动的崛起缘由，并回溯这项运动如何从殖民地贵族项目发展成为今天在中产阶级普及的运动。 香港奥运代表团历史佳绩和未能摆脱的政治阴影 香港赢得久违奥运金牌 张家朗获得男子花剑冠军 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 东西合璧的训练体系 “她一定没问题的。”江旻憓决赛落后法国对手时，在电视直播节目以运动员身分当旁述的朱嘉望淡定地说。 图像来源， Getty Images 她没有说错，江旻憓最终逆转胜夺金。朱嘉望接受BBC中文访问时说：“我当时这么坚定地说，是因为我很相信Vivian（江旻憓）的实力。我看过她跟同一位对手打过很多次，每一次都是前段落后、后面追赢。” 29岁的朱嘉望是江旻憓的队友，上届东京奥运她们首次打入奥运女子剑击团体赛，两人都是香港体育学院（体院）的全职精英运动员，每周训练六天共25至30小时，上午炼体能，下午进行对打和技术训练。 该队以前由华人担任教练，2011年总教练郑兆康上任后大幅改革，聘请一批欧洲世界级教练，包括张家朗的法国人教练Gregory Koenig（Greg）和江旻憓的罗马尼亚教练Octavian-Petru Zidaru（Tavi）。郑兆康形容，十多年来打下的基础，现在是“收成期”，朱嘉望也表示这彻底改变了队内训练文化，给运动员全新的思维。 “Greg的风格是给运动员多一些放松时间，但一练习就很专注和高强度，这样才更加平衡，让人更加享受到练习和比赛。Tavi的风格也是不会把你逼得好紧，反而较讲究技术和细节。” 图像来源， Getty Images 张家朗的教练是法国人格雷各（Gregory Koenig，Greg） 她说教练团队也有来自香港本地、中国大陆和韩国的亚洲人，亚洲教练较重视基本功，因此港队成员都有“教科书水平”的标准手势和步法，打剑速度也非常快，在此基础上接受欧洲教练的训练就更上一层楼。 “不同国籍的教练互相配合很重要，以我们女子重剑为例，Tavi用欧洲模式做主，而中国教练姜海涛会配合他，他更了解亚洲人的身高、体型特性，知道如何把欧洲那一套改良和应用在我们身上。”朱嘉望对BBC中文说，“这样我们东西方的优点都兼备，而始终剑击是欧洲主导的运动，熟悉欧洲人的思维就更适合打欧洲对手。” 在巴黎卫冕金牌的张家朗也曾受访透露，法国教练格雷各加盟港队的第一法则是“你必须open-minded（思维开放）”，他要求运动员改掉“苦练就是好”的观念，鼓励他们了解自己而不是盲目遵守规矩，这启发了张家朗打剑时不只看招式的表面，还要思考每一个“为什么”。 图像来源， Moonie Chu 从左到右依次为中国教练姜海涛、江旻憓、余缮妡、陈渭泠、朱嘉望以及罗马尼亚教练Tavi 心态与海外经验 张家朗在决赛对战意大利的马基（Filippo Macchi），对方及其教练在整场赛事都被指十分“火爆”，失分时手舞喧叫及向裁判施压。“决一剑”时，双方曾两度刺中对方，裁判判定攻击无效，直到第三剑才判张家朗获胜，过程充满戏剧性。 而江旻憓决赛对阵东道主法国的剑手玛露比顿（Auriane Mallo-Breton）时，现场法国观众呐喊声沸腾，法国总统马克龙也亲自到场观战，她在巨大压力下初段落后，三个回合后追平并“决一剑”胜出。 图像来源， Getty Images 两人能在短时间内调整心态被视为致胜关键，没有受现场气氛或对手情绪干扰。对此，同为港队成员的朱嘉望认为，除了教练的启发，体院的运动心理中心也应记一功。 她说该院有数名心理学家，其中两位负责照顾剑击队，经常在训练期间观察运动员的心理状态，并会随队一同去亚锦赛、世锦赛、奥运等重要赛事。 “我们和他经常见，他很熟悉我们，我们也随时可以找他聊天，是他教会了我冥想，怎样在高压环境下把专注力放在当下，这些思想的练习对于比赛帮助很大。”朱嘉望说，“因为剑击好像下棋，不是斗体力，更多的是斗智、斗心、斗经验，心理质素是关键。” 另一方面，香港剑击队非常重视海外交流，运动员每年要到海外参加七、八个比赛，包括剑击世锦赛、亚锦赛和世界杯，教练会在赛事之间安排为期两周至一个月的海外集训，每年至少四次，让运动员适应时差和累积国际经验。 “所以我们经常去法国，每个剑击队成员都很熟悉巴黎。”朱嘉望笑道。 她说在海外集训也是跟着原有教练，但气氛会比平日更专注，也可以与各国对手切磋，并观摩其它国家教练的教法。“例如在去年世锦赛前的集训，一位日本教练带领了一个环节，教所有剑手脚法，我们学到以前从没学过的技巧。” 朱嘉望补充指，全世界的剑击队都有海外集训，是常态，但港队在这两届奥运前的预备时间里，明显投放了更多资源，“总教练安排给我们的集训多了很多，而成绩也反映出是值得的”。 殖民地时期的历史渊源 香港剑击队有今天的“收成期”，有赖过去几十年来播下的种子。而追溯剑击运动在香港的历史渊源，得回到港英时代。 图像来源， Getty Images 除了张家朗、江旻憓之外，香港还有年轻剑手崭露头角，例如19岁新星陈诺斯（前排右二）。 剑击是欧洲运动，香港作为前英国殖民地，二战前已有剑击爱好者，主要是洋人，一批葡藉剑手在二战期间移居澳门并接受前葡萄牙奥运选手训练，战后回流香港，其后在港的英军剑手也开始参与本地剑击活动，促成1949年成立香港业余剑击总会，并获加入英联邦剑击协会。 上世纪五十年代，这项运动慢慢打进华人精英阶层，喇沙、拔萃等由教会办学的传统名校陆续成立剑击校队，1960年举办第一届校际剑击比赛，带动其它名校的剑击风潮。 “英国人到海外拓展殖民地，都会把英国的运动文化输出去，包括剑击、足球、羽毛球等，而这些变成英联邦体育文化，香港受影响很深。”香港教育大学健康与体育学系高级讲师雷雄德博士对BBC中文说。 这些传统名校可说是香港第一代剑击运动员的摇篮，以剑击闻名的前财政司司长曾俊华，就是60年代初中就读喇沙书院时首次接触剑击。 他高中移居美国后继续学剑，大学时曾任麻省理工学院读书剑击队队长，80年代回港后到母校喇沙担任义务剑击教练，一教就是30年，不少港队现役剑手都曾是他的学生，包括曾出战上届东京奥运、目前世界排名第20的男子花剑运动员蔡俊彦。 时至今日，会剑击的小孩报读名校时仍可获加分，足见剑击在香港精英阶层的传统地位。 而剑击从上世纪六七十年代的名校小圈子运动，到八十年代逐渐普及化，转捩点也跟殖民地政策息息相关。 “二战前后，各国把体育纳入国家政策，关乎教育、生产力、军事训练和国家荣誉。但香港不是一个国家，殖民地政府也不重视体育，情况在六七暴动后改变。”雷雄德博士说。 1967年“六七暴动”后港英政府改变治港方针，引入多项社会改革，开始重视青年政策并注重体育发展，举办包含竞技比赛在内的“香港节”，1973年成立康乐体育局。 “政府认为年轻人太多‘剩余精力’无处发泄才会参与暴动，所以开始推广体育。英国政府在处理英国本土青年犯罪问题时也是这个思维。”雷雄德博士说，“在学术上，体育本身就有凝聚社会的功能，可以净化社会不安。” 两万剑手的城市 1982年，港英政府与赛马会合资在沙田成立银禧体育中心，即香港体育学院前身，负责培训精英运动员及推广体育活动，成立之初剑击已是九个重点项目之一，正式把剑击带到社区。 图像来源， Getty Images 雷雄德忆述，他上世纪八十年代初刚从师范学院体育系毕业，曾参加教育司署与银禧合办给体育教师的课程，进修冷门项目如剑击、独木舟、射击等。“教师学会了，带回一般的中小学，基层学生才接触到，造就年轻人有兴趣。现在的剑击总会高层当初也是这样学剑的。” 与此同时，银禧训练出一批精英剑击运动员，九十年代退役后成为教练人才，纷纷在民间开办私人剑击学校。 53岁的前剑击港队成员李永强就是其中一人，他1998年曾代表香港出战亚运会，退役后担任教练，2012年开办私人剑校香港剑击学院，见证着剑击社群壮大。“我30年前玩剑击，全香港才500多人，现在只是一个小学学界比赛已经有两三千人。” 他对BBC中文指出，以前剑击是贵族活动，但随着香港经济起飞、中产阶级崛起，可负担的家庭越来越多，小孩也越来越早开始学习，从中学阶段逐渐提前至小学、幼稚园，最早的甚至3岁就开始学。他说以中小学学界比赛分别有两三千人参加，加上幼儿、大专和成人，保守估计目前全港习剑人数多达2万人。 “张家朗也是这样出来，基层越多人玩、越早开始玩，我们选材基础就越扩大，选出来的精英就越强。体院集中训练精英，私人剑校负责基层推广，这30年来做了很好的分工，建立了整个系统——所以金牌不是突然冒出来的，是三代人的努力。” 新一代剑手 香港剑击运动的成就能否持续，要靠第四代人的努力。张家朗在巴黎奥运卫冕后受访时说，香港是个很小的城市，但“只要相信自己，不要因为（生于）一个很小的地方而放弃”。 图像来源， Getty Images 和他同代学剑的年轻教练贺扬则认为，正正是香港地方小，有很大优势，参加比赛很方便。 “外国地方大，小孩要去别的剑会比赛，可能要整个家庭一起出行、去好几天，但香港胜在够密集，一个尖沙咀已经有六七间剑校，就算去澳门或内地也很近，可以当天来回，这样我们的比赛经验相比其他国家的人更丰富。” 三年前东京奥运后的张家朗效应，让香港剑校如雨后春筍，目前香港剑击总会旗下属会有近50家。 贺扬也是在两年前创办剑校英汇剑击学院，他说他这一辈人棒做社区推广，开始革新教学模式，“不想像以前那种高压教育，把小孩逼得很紧，反而是营造快乐打剑的气氛”。他又认为新一代的剑校文化已经改变，更愿意互相合作，相信可吸引更多人投身剑击运动。 “我小时候学剑的体验很差，你愿意给钱他都未必肯教，就算教也是挤牙膏式，山头主义很严重。但我们这一代，成长于网络时代，所有资讯都很透明，更加愿意分享资源和合作，这样对整个剑击界都有好处。” 除了私人剑击学校，一般的中小学也对剑击持更开放态度。 本身是剑击教练的何莉恺在新界沙田区一家中学任教，她一年前在校内成立剑击队，目前有13人。她说当初向校长提出建议后，校方爽快答应。 图像来源， AFP “首先要多谢张家朗效应，让所有香港人认识了剑击。”她笑道。 “其次是用成本说服校长，其实剑击没有大家想像中那麽贵，教练费跟篮球队差不多，场地一个羽毛球场已经符合要求，只是买个裁判器，一般学校都可以承担。” 她补充指，自从国际剑联认可中国制造的服装和器材，市面上已有大量平价装备可供选择，投身剑击的门槛大大降低，现在背景较基层的南亚裔学生也积极参与，种族更多元化。 对此，学者雷雄德和前港队成员李永强都表示乐见，相信随着基层选手人数增多、种族更多元，香港剑击队将一代胜过一代。 “其实现在的学生，已经比张家朗小时候更厉害，以后的成绩非常令人期待。”李永强说。",

    "description": "12 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 拜登看着格什克维奇在抵达美国后给母亲一个大大的拥抱。 包括《华尔街日报》记者伊凡·格什科维奇（Evan Gershkovich）在内的三名美国人在与俄罗斯进行的囚犯交换协议中获释。美国囚犯都已安全返回美国领土。美国总统拜登（Joe Biden）和副总统卡马拉·哈里斯（kamala harris）亲自前往机场迎接他们，获释囚犯每个人都与家人拥抱。 32岁的格什科维奇是从俄罗斯监狱被交换的16名囚犯之一。俄国并接回了8名在美服刑的俄罗斯囚犯。 此次被称为冷战结束以来美俄两国最大规模的换囚行动。 这个在土耳其机场进行的换囚行动释放了前美国海军陆战队员保罗·惠伦（Paul Whelan）以及拥有俄美双重国籍的另一名记者阿尔苏·库尔马谢娃（Alsu Kurmasheva）。 在抵达马里兰州的美军安德鲁联合基地后，格什科维奇等三人从飞机上走下来，受到现场人员的热烈欢呼。 他们在机场跑道上停留拍照和交谈，不到一小时就离开了空军基地。拜登的车队也随后离开。 在他们返回美国之际，拜登在机场欢迎他们获释归来，并称“他们受的残酷折磨已经结束了”。 拜登在现场说：“想像一下，若你被不公平地扣押而你的孩子就在家里，你会有什么感受？” 他又补充称“想像在监狱里，不知何时才能回家。不知道孩子们的状况，他们晚上是否哭着入睡？每天你不在他们身边都是如何度过的？这些都很重要。” 拜登亦赞扬了美国盟友特别是德国和斯洛文尼亚所发挥的作用，并将格什科维奇等三人获释以及克里姆林宫批评人士弗拉基米尔·卡拉-穆尔扎（Vladimir Kara-Murza）的释放称为“外交成就”。 三名获释的美国公民将被送往德州的布鲁克陆军医院进行健康检查。 美伊完成换囚：美国解冻60亿美元伊朗资金，五名被押美公民飞离伊朗 美俄换囚 女篮明星与“死亡商人”各自获释返国 普京80年代的东德特工证件在德国曝光 澳大利亚华裔记者成蕾获释回国 曾遭“泄密”指控和判刑 图像来源， US Government 白宫发布的照片显示格什科维奇(左)、库尔马谢娃(右)和惠伦(右二)等人在从俄罗斯被囚中获释后登上飞机。 谈判历时18个月 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 事实上，此次交换协议的谈判历时超过18个月。 关键在于莫斯科要求返还在德国服刑的俄国杀手瓦季姆·克拉西科夫（瓦迪姆·克拉西科夫）。他被指控曾在柏林市中心公园被毒杀流亡海外的前车臣叛军指挥官甘戈什维利（Zelimkhan Khangoshvili）。 克拉西科夫现已返回俄罗斯。 土耳其总统府则称，共有24名来自7个不同国家的囚犯在土耳其安卡拉交换，其中包括美国、德国、波兰、斯洛文尼亚、挪威、俄罗斯和白俄罗斯的囚犯。其中10人（包括2名未成年人）被遣返至俄罗斯，13名囚犯被送至德国，3人送抵美国。 在俄罗斯，普京在莫斯科机场亲自用花束迎接获释的俄罗斯人。他在红毯上热情地拥抱了他们，并表示他们将获得国家奖励。除了克拉西科夫，还有一对在斯洛维尼亚被判间谍罪的俄罗斯夫妇，他们和两个孩子一起返回俄罗斯。 北约和欧洲联盟都欢迎这次释放并称这是由土耳其斡旋达成的。德国公民李科·克里格尔（Rico Krieger）此前在白俄罗斯被判处死刑，但本周白俄罗斯领导人卢卡申科对他进行了赦免，他也已获释。 事实上，此前关于交换囚犯的讨论曾包括当时被监禁的俄罗斯反对派领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexander Lukashenkoe）。但是当他在今年2月份于北极监狱以不明原因去世时，此交换方案濒临报废。他的遗孀尤利娅·纳瓦尔娜（Yulia Navalnaya）称此次换囚让她感到欣喜。 在换囚前几天就有消息传出各国即将进行的一次重大换囚。而且在此之前，数名在俄罗斯被监禁的异见人士和记者被从监狱转移到不明地点。尽管俄罗斯秘密转移囚犯较常见，但知名的囚犯大量失踪并不寻常。 过去最近一次高调换囚发生在2022年12月。当时美国篮球明星布兰妮·格莱纳（Brittney Griner）在阿布达比机场被交换回美国，莫斯科换回了在美监狱服刑12年的俄罗斯军火商维克多·布特（Viktor Bout）。 上一次类似的换囚发生在2010年的维也纳。当时10名在美国被捕的俄罗斯间谍与4名涉嫌在俄罗斯担任双重间谍的人交换。其中一人是前军事情报官员谢尔盖·斯克里帕尔（Sergei Skripa），他在2018年被毒杀于英格兰西南索尔兹伯里市（Salisbury）。 近年来莫斯科与西方的紧张局势不断升高，尤其是自2022年2月普京发动入侵乌克兰以来。 图像来源， Getty Images 2023 年 10 月在喀山被拘留的记者库尔马舍娃 (Alsu Kurmasheva) 在女儿们之间 分析：可能不会是最后一次 BBC俄罗斯事务编辑史蒂夫·罗森伯格（Steve Rosenberg） 这是自冷战以来最大规模的东西方囚犯交换。西方政府将欢迎国人获释，以及俄罗斯一些最著名的政治犯获得自由。莫斯科则将庆祝其特工的归来。 双方都会声称这是一笔好交易。 但如果俄罗斯像过去一样认定“人质外交”可行，令人担忧的是这种利用囚犯作为筹码的做法可能不会是最后一次。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69236684",
    "description": "黄思琪（Kelly Ng） BBC记者 35 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 汤慕涵是征战巴黎奥运会的中国队31名游泳选手之一。 世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）表示，由于中美两国的地缘政治紧张局势蔓延到奥运会舞台，该机构被“不公平地卷入”中美之间的争执中。 在遭遇一系列兴奋剂指控之后，中国的顶尖游泳运动员被置于聚光灯下，随后美国声称世界反兴奋剂机构掩盖此事，这引起了争议。 前往巴黎参赛的中国游泳运动员接受药检的次数是一些其他国家选手的两倍，这反过来又引发了对中国运动员受到阴谋干扰的指控。 世界反兴奋剂机构在周二的声明中说，它被卷入了“超级大国之间的地缘政治紧张局势，但却只能置身事外”。 “（美国）某些人纯粹是想通过这些涉事运动员是中国人来捞取政治筹码。”世界反兴奋剂机构媒体关系总监詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James Fitzgerald）对BBC说。“结果是，这在反兴奋剂系统内部造成了不信任和分裂。” 贸易战、地缘政治对抗以及北京与俄罗斯的友好关系已经使中美这两大经济体的关系恶化。 在竞技体育中出现这样的紧张情势并不奇怪，但现在它们似乎正在引发一场更强硬和严厉的对立。 上周，世界反兴奋剂机构表示，它正在考虑就“诽谤性”指控对美国反兴奋剂机构（USADA）采取法律行动。 后者指责世界反兴奋剂机构和中国反兴奋剂中心（Chinada）是“掩盖阳性检测结果和压制勇敢举报人声音的黑手”之一。 美国议员也指责世界反兴奋剂机构未能妥善调查针对中国游泳运动员的兴奋剂指控。本周二，他们提出了一项法案，赋予白宫削减该机构资金的权力。 “当国会议员和参议员们把自己融入反兴奋剂这个技术性很强的领域时，这就不再是科学和法律分析的问题，而是滑向了政治领域。”菲茨杰拉德说。 受污染食品和营养补充剂 在世界反兴奋剂机构周二发表声明之前，《纽约时报》报道了一起此前未公开的案件，涉及两名中国游泳运动员，其中包括一名今年的奥运代表队成员，他们因涉嫌服用兴奋剂而受到调查。 他们在2022年被检测出体内一种禁用类固醇呈阳性，但他们被允许参加比赛。中国反兴奋剂中心的结论是，这两名运动员很可能是在食用受污染的汉堡时，在不知情的情况下摄入了类固醇。 美国反兴奋剂机构指责世界反兴奋剂机构让中国“在一套不同的规则下比赛，使赛场向他们倾斜”。 但世界反兴奋剂机构为这一说法进行了辩护。该机构称，运动员的营养补充剂和毛发检测结果均为阴性，两名游泳运动员在一次检测呈阳性前后几天提供的对照样本也均为阴性。 它补充说，这两名游泳运动员被禁赛一年多，然后便结案了。 该机构说，他们的案件是“涉及来自不同运动项目的（中国）运动员的一系列更广泛案例”的一部分，并补充称，“根据案例数量，显然在全球多个国家都存在污染问题”。 在6月的一份声明中，世界反兴奋剂机构指出，吃肉的运动员如果摄入了瘦肉精，有时会出现药检呈阳性的情况。瘦肉精是一种被禁用的物质，被用作家畜的生长促进剂。 在回答《纽约时报》的问题时，该机构表示正在调查中国以及墨西哥、危地马拉和其他国家的污染事件。 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 巴黎奥运会开幕式如何与众不同？这些是目前已知的要点 巴黎奥运：从性别平等、独特开幕式到俄罗斯运动员，你可能忽略的一些重要细节 图像来源， Getty Images 美国官员指责世界反兴奋剂机构“不公平地”偏袒中国游泳运动员。 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” 该机构的负责人奥利维尔·尼格里（Olivier Niggli）当时指出，美国媒体“只问有关中国的问题，而肉类污染在许多国家都是个问题”，并提到“有人试图将反兴奋剂政治化”。 今年4月，《纽约时报》报道称，在2021年东京奥运会前几个月，23名中国游泳运动员在被检测是否服用提高成绩的药物时呈阳性，这掀起了轩然大波。 但在中国官员发现药检结果是由污染造成后，他们获准参赛。这支30人的队伍在东京奥运会上赢得了六枚奖牌，包括三枚金牌。其中11名药检呈阳性的运动员还被选入出征巴黎奥运会的中国游泳队。 美国游泳运动员、11枚奥运奖牌得主凯蒂·莱德基（Katie Ledecky）曾表示，在23名中国游泳运动员药检阳性的消息传出后，她对反兴奋剂监管机构的信心降到了“历史最低点”。 然而，世界反兴奋剂机构的调查发现，它“无法否认污染的可能性”是这种治疗心脏病的药物曲美他嗪（TMZ）的来源。 该机构表示，有鉴于受检运动员中，“曲美他嗪的浓度一直很低，且没有服用兴奋剂的模式”，这些因素都支持了污染的可能性。也就是说，运动员们几天的测试结果不一致，在阴性和阳性之间摇摆。 一项独立调查发现，世界反兴奋剂机构没有处理不当，也没有对中国游泳运动员表现出偏向性。 美中巨头间的冲突 这些丑闻加大了反兴奋剂官员的压力，当中国游泳队抵达巴黎时，他们接受的药检远远超过了标准。 据负责监管水上运动的世界泳联（World Aquatics）称，自今年1月以来，中国游泳队的31名队员平均每人接受了21次不同反兴奋剂组织的药检。 相比之下，澳大利亚的41名游泳运动员平均接受了4次药检，美国的46名游泳运动员平均接受了6次药检。 这一系列检测引发了另一系列指控。中国官方报纸《环球时报》指责西方大国“滥用兴奋剂检测扰乱中国游泳队”。 图像来源， Getty Images 张雨霏在100米蝶泳比赛中获得铜牌。 上海一位国际政治学教授在接受《环球时报》采访时，指责美国主导了反兴奋剂规则。 沈毅称，“苛刻和不道德的检测”扰乱了中国队的训练，并称这是“奥运会的耻辱”。 保持着男子200米蛙泳世界纪录的中国游泳选手覃海洋说，这些药检表明“近几年中国游泳队的成绩让欧美强队感受到了威胁”。 “一些小把戏意图扰乱我们的备战节奏，摧毁我们的心理防线。但我们不会惧怕。”他在中国社交媒体平台微博上说。 覃海洋曾在去年的世锦赛上夺得50米、100米和200米蛙泳金牌，他在周日的男子100米蛙泳决赛中获得第七名。 中国前跳水冠军高敏也提出了同样的批评。她说，苛刻的测试“干扰了我们中国游泳队”，并称覃海洋的表现是“这两年所有比赛中最差的一次”。 中国目前的奖牌总数为一金两银两铜。 中国的“蝶后”张雨霏在东京奥运会上获得了100米蝶泳银牌。在周一，她为自己获得铜牌而流泪，但表示兴奋剂检测对她没有太大影响。 她说，虽然兴奋剂检测是“有点烦躁”，但更多的是“远远大于”想象的压力。 梁艳婷（Annabelle Liang）补充报道。",

    "title": "上半年经济形势堪忧 中共政治局会议传递了哪些信息",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-69234753",
    "description": "21 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 7月30日举行中共政治局会议主题是“分析研究当前经济形势，部署下半年经济工作”，中共高层表示要“坚定不移完成全年经济社会发展目标任务”。 对于中国经济而言，亟待回答的问题是，能否完成“5%左右”的全年经济增长目标？ 今年一季度，中国经济增长势头不错，GDP增速5.3%；第二季度却大幅低于各机构预测，仅为4.7%，使得上半年整体经济增速为5%，与全年目标持平。 专家表示 ，今年下半年的基数效应将有所减弱，使得通往5%的道路充满挑战，如果要实现这一目标，可能需要看到进一步的政策支持。 GDP增速是基于去年同期经济数据计算的增长速率，去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 分析指出，这次政治局会议传递出的四个发力方向能否兑现，还需要进一步观察。 中国到底有没有“产能过剩”？为何事关欧美？ 欧盟打了中国最疼爱的“孩子”：对华电动车关税落地 最高48.1% 二十届三中全会：300多项改革出台 2029年中国人的生活将是什么样？ 宏观政策：刺激可能加力 宏观政策，通常指各国政府通过“货币政策”或“财政政策”来调节经济，通俗而言，就是“印钱”和“撒钱”。 对比4月30日的政治局会议，对下阶段宏观政策的表述明显不同：上次会议称“要靠前发力有效落实已经确定的宏观政策”；这次会议称“宏观政策要持续用力、更加给力”、“要加强逆周期调节”、“加大宏观调控力度”等。 安邦智库分析称，上次会议到这次会议之间，中国的宏观政策均处于观望期。这是因为此前美国尚未传递出明显的降息信号，中国降息空间没有打开。 但这一形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，中国需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安邦智库认为，会议字里行间的表述意味着下半年积极的财政政策将通过发行更多的国债和地方债来完成，而在“防风险”和“稳增长”之间，财政政策真正能够“加力”的空间，仍需要依靠发行特别国债等“国债财政”来实现。 “外部压力的增加，包括特朗普的潜在回归，凸显了刺激国内经济的紧迫性。”经济学人智库（EIU）首席中国经济学家苏月向BBC中文表示，假定其它因素保持不变，特朗普上台后如果中国对美出口额外增加 10%的关税，会使中国2025和2026年的GDP 增长率平均下降0.3-0.4个百分点。那么更果断的国内政策和财政扩张才可减轻部分影响。 图像来源， Getty Image 中国经济形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安抚民营企业 2020年底，习近平在一次企业家座谈会上提到“弘扬企业家精神”。但之后新冠疫情中实施的严厉封控，以及政府先后对对房地产、互联网、教培等行业的强力监管，让很多民营企业的日子不好过，信心严重受损。 今年7月15日的二十届三中全会的文件中再次出现“企业家精神”，本次政治局会议则试图强调民营企业的重要性： 比如，防止和纠正一些地方利用行政、刑事手段干预经济纠纷；要有力有效支持发展瞪羚企业、独角兽企业；要弘扬企业家精神，在改革创新和公平竞争中加快建设更多世界一流企业。 苏月解释称，会议特别关注民营企业、高增长企业和独角兽企业，并再次强调保护产权。会议没有过多提及国有企业，这表明下半年的重点将放在民营企业上。 “会议旨在通过提出切实可行的改革措施，解决以往政策执行不力的问题。会议还强调要遏制地方政府利用行政和刑事手段干预经济纠纷，完善市场机制。”苏月预计，这些政策方向将对信心产生“轻微的积极影响”。 首提防“内卷式”恶性竞争 图像来源， Getty Image 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”一词，而防“内卷式恶性竞争”首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中。 “内卷式”恶性竞争首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中——“要强化行业自律”，“强化市场优胜劣汰机制，畅通落后低效产能退出渠道”。 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”来形容这一问题。 苏月称，“内卷式”恶性竞争的提法可以理解为官方对产能过剩问题的回应，有助于缓解贸易压力。 在今年4月之前，对“产能过剩”的讨论和担忧，广泛存在于中国自己的官方语境和媒体舆论中。 比如，去年年底召开的中央经济工作会议指出，进一步推动经济回升向好需要克服一些困难和挑战，其中即包括“部分行业产能过剩”。今年3月的“两会”上，政府工作报告对此予以重申。 而上一次“产能过剩”出现在中央经济工作会议上，还是五年前。 2023年末，中国汽车制造、计算机通信电子、纺织业、食品制造业、医药制造业和电气机械等行业的产能利用率，甚至低于2016年末。 到今年4月，“产能过剩”突然成为中国对外贸易的热词——4日到9日，美国财长耶伦访华，点名了三个中国的产业产能过剩，可能会伤害美国；16日，德国总理朔尔茨访华，再提对“产能过剩”的关切。到了7月，欧盟对中国电动车加征额外的关税。 此后，中国避免使用“产能过剩”来描述供给侧的问题，而开始强调防“内卷式”恶性竞争。 “这与此前电池、光伏退出落后产能的相关政策一脉相承，也是从中央层面上明确定调要实施供给侧改革。”安邦智库表示，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争，例如新能源车、光伏、锂电池等。 “不过，实施供给侧改革政策的主要考量何在？‘内卷’行业如何自律？过剩的产能如何出清？是否会通过技术标准以行政手段强行关停一些项目？以及是否会在信贷上收紧来强制出清竞争力不足的企业？这一系列后续仍有待观察。” 图像来源， Getty Image 分析指，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争。 如何拉动消费 此次会议频繁提及增加收入、促进消费。 会议指出，“要以提振消费为重点扩大国内需求，经济政策的着力点要更多转向惠民生、促消费，要多渠道增加居民收入，增强中低收入群体的消费能力和意愿，把服务消费作为消费扩容升级的重要抓手，支持文旅、养老、育幼、家政等消费。” “中央政府非常重视保持扶贫成果，并将重点放在对低收入群体的转移支付上。”不过，苏月提醒，中等收入家庭的收入增长乏力与房地产行业的困境息息相关，这凸显了制定以家庭为重点的财政政策的必要性。 安邦智库注意到，促进消费的重点将放在以文旅、养老、育幼、家政为代表的服务消费上，实际上服务业在就业结构中占据了很大一部分，推动服务消费也可以解决就业的问题。 “但就多渠道增加居民收入而言，通过哪些渠道？如何才能让老百姓增加收入？这些并未提及。”安邦智库分析认为，在消费这个问题上，采取修修补补的设备更新和智能化改造措施是没问题的，但要真正拉动“消费—收入”的循环链条，还要回归到能否扭转市场对未来经济的预期上。",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69234346",
    "description": "28 分钟前 图像来源， EPA 哈马斯高层则表示该组织陷入了震惊状态。 伊朗指责以色列周三（7月31日）在首都德黑兰暗杀了哈马斯领导人伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚（Ismail Haniyeh）， 并威胁对以色列实施“严厉惩罚”。以色列并未直接对哈尼亚的死发表评论。 然而，以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡则称，近日他的国家对敌人“迎头重击”，在黎巴嫩击毙一名黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官。 他向色列民众表示“艰难日子即将到来”，因为中东局势正在升温，对于该区域爆发更大规模军事冲突的忧虑越来越高。“自贝鲁特行动以来， 我们听到各方的威胁，”内塔尼亚胡在电视讲话中表示。 “我们已做好准备应对任何情况，我们将团结一致、坚定不移，”他强调。 不过，联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯警告不要让局势“危险升级”。 哈尼亚被杀重创以巴停火前景。哈马斯武装部门表示，被广泛视为该组织政治领袖的哈尼亚遇刺将“战斗推向新的境界”并造成重大影响。哈马斯去年10月7日在以色列境内发动攻击造成约1200人丧生。 此后，以色列誓言摧毁哈马斯。 哈马斯称领导人哈尼亚在伊朗遇刺身亡 誓言进行报复 中国站在以色列与哈马斯面前的三个问题 一文看懂巴以冲突关键角色：哈马斯是谁？ 以巴冲突：揭开哈马斯高层人物的面纱 哈尼亚在曾在加沙停火谈判中扮演重要角色。他在周三出席伊朗新总统梅赫迪·巴哈达德·岛加德就职仪式后不久遇害。 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调，哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。当时还有3名哈马斯领导人和数名警卫与他同在这栋楼内。 哈马斯高层哈利勒·阿勒-哈亚在记者会上引述一名目击者的话称，一枚导弹直接命中了哈尼亚。 哈尼亚从20世纪80年代末开始成为哈马斯的重要成员。作为位于卡塔尔的政治局主席，他负责与地区政府的联系，也是哈马斯与德黑兰及其在中东地区的代理人组织之间的核心人物。数月来，他一直是以色列当局通缉的目标。BBC了解到，因为安全考虑，他最近一次前往黎巴嫩的行程被他的保安小组否决。 但是他很少参与哈马斯的军事行动，因此可能感到自己比一些同伙更能公开行动。这也反映在自10月7日以色列遭遇袭击事件后，他曾有过三次前往伊朗的行程。 根据报导，在哈尼亚遇袭身亡之前，关于他的继任问题已开始浮现。根据哈马斯的宪法，政治局主席最多只能连任两届，新的候选人原定于2025年选出。 图像来源， EPA 哈尼亚周二出现在伊朗议会。周三（7月31日）出席伊朗新总统就职仪式后不久遇害。 哈尼亚的去世可能会加速该组织内部的权力角力。阿拉伯外交官普遍认为，与其他哈马斯高层相比，哈尼亚是一个较为务实的人物。他主导了哈马斯与区域政府的政治接触，而非偏向军事行动。这种战略与穆罕默德·代夫等领导人的取向不同，因为后者领导着哈马斯的军事部门。就在本月初以色列声称在加沙的空袭击中了代夫，但未能证实其是否遇难。 一名哈马斯官员告诉BBC：“哈马斯是一个理念，是一种意识形态。领导人的被杀并不会改变它，亦不会让哈马斯投降或让步。” 这似乎是试图淡化组织内部可能存在的紧张局势。 此外，就在哈尼亚遭杀害前几个小时，以色列称，其已在贝鲁特击毙黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官福阿德·舒库尔（Fuad Shukur）。以色列认为，他策划了上周末对戈兰高地发动的火箭弹攻击，这次袭击造成12人死亡。但真主党否认参与其中。 但真主党的报复是很可能发生的。因为这个受伊朗支持，实力强大的组织过去曾在领导人被杀害后，向以色列发射大量火箭弹作为回应。 美国已更新了对公民的旅行指引，警告他们说，因为“局势紧张升高”，不要前往黎巴嫩。英国外交大臣也敦促本国公民离开黎巴嫩。一些国际航空公司业已取消了飞往贝鲁特之航班。预计联合航空、达美航空和英国航空也将宣布暂停飞往以色列特拉维夫的班机。 图像来源， WAEL HAMZEH/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。 分析：以色列的豪赌 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion BBC国际事务编辑杰里米·鲍文（Jeremy Bowen） 以色列给予其敌人两次重创。 虽然以色列并未承认他们在德黑兰杀害了哈马斯政治领袖伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚，但很难想到还有谁能比以色列更想要他的命。 至于黎巴嫩真主党指挥官富阿德·舒克尔，以色列则表示他在贝鲁特遭到一次“基于情报的消除行动”中丧生。 对以色列而言，哈马斯内部任何大人物都是他们猎杀的目标。因为去年10月7日哈马斯的攻击造成了自1948年以来以色列最惨重的单日伤亡。 以色列表示，杀害舒克尔是因为这位资深的真主党指挥官，要为导致12名儿童和年轻人在以色列占领的戈兰高地丧生的火箭弹攻击负责。 真主党确认舒克尔在贝鲁特的突袭行动中丧命，但他们否认发动了在戈兰高地的攻击。 无论如何，中东再次充斥着自去年10月7日以来，即将到来的全面战争的恐怖猜测。而且，残酷且讽刺的一点在于双方都不希望爆发这场战争，但却越来越准备冒险。 以色列一直受到美国盟友的压力，要求他们对真主党的报复保持克制，并在不引发毁灭性报复和引发更大规模战争的情况下去打击真主党。 但这两次暗杀行动等同于一次巨大的赌博。 压力下，以色列希望对真主党造成打击但不引发毁灭性报复。但真主党领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉仍可能作出这样的决定：因为以色列对他们在贝鲁特南部的大本营发动攻击，真主党就应该对特拉维夫进行同样力度的回击。 以色列可能也已经评估过，在伊朗境内及层层保护下杀害了这名巴勒斯坦领导人，德黑兰也不会对其宣战。 哈尼亚刚会见了伊朗新任总统就丢了性命，这无疑是以色列战力的一次戏剧性展示。 伊朗伊斯兰共和国称，在今年4月对以色列发射数百枚导弹和无人机后已重建了抵御敌军的战力，但这一说法现已被证实是空洞的。当时发动的炮击是报复以色列之前空袭了位于大马士革的伊朗大使馆并杀害了2名伊朗将军。 现在看来伊朗、其盟友黎巴嫩真主党或其代理人很可能会再次进行报复。亲伊朗的伊拉克民兵已明确表示，针对暗杀事件，他们也指责并要求华盛顿负责。在红海地区，也许也会看到胡塞武装分子从也门（叶门）加大对以色列的攻击。 因为数月来来在加沙地带遭受以色列猛攻，哈马斯反击能力有限。而以色列对在其占领的西岸或在国内遭受攻击的可能性都有高度警惕。 众人必须认知到，中东地区已陷入了一场区域性战争，而且情况可能会变得更加糟。在这个世界上最动荡地区，战争的风险即严峻又清晰可见，我们很容易想像并构建各种战争情景。但即便如此，这一轮杀戮和报复也未必会引发全面战争。 一次又一次化解，无法减少全面战争的可能性。这也使得建立一条远离全面冲突威胁的外交途径变得更加困难。 如何降低中东致命高温？唯一有效的第一步就是加沙停火。",

    "description": "艾奥内·威尔斯（Ione Wells）&amp; 凡妮莎·布施施吕特（Vanessa Buschschlüter） BBC记者 发自加拉加斯和伦敦 11 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 在南美国家委内瑞拉总统选举的争议“结果揭晓”后，首都加拉加斯街头爆发了新一轮的示威。 数千人聚集在委内瑞拉首都市中心，抗议现任总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicolas Maduro）宣称拿下胜利。 许多人认为，他们不会停止抗议，直到出现新政府。有些人还说，只有当国家安全部队加入反对派示威，新政府才会出现。 但是该国军队和警察到目前为止仍然忠诚于马杜罗，并开始对一些抗议者发射催泪瓦斯和橡胶子弹。 委内瑞拉地方官员称约有750人被逮捕。该国两家主要的非政府组织表示，至今已有数名民众死亡，数十人受伤。 周二（7月30日），委内瑞拉国防部长将抗议活动称为是一场“政变”。 被武装部队的保护下，弗拉基米尔·帕德里诺（Vladimir Padrino）将军宣读了一份声明称，马杜罗总统拥有军队的“绝对忠诚和无条件的支持。” 此外，马杜罗的亲密盟友、委内瑞拉检察长说，在反政府抗议活动中一名士兵已被杀害。 委内瑞拉：中俄印六大国选边站队各有考量 委内瑞拉危机：伊朗油轮与美国军舰或在海上对峙 中国向委内瑞拉再伸援手 习近平马杜罗各有所图 委内瑞拉危机：七张图帮你梳理头绪 图像来源， Getty Images 示威者向BBC强调他们发现大选舞弊证。 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多（Maria Corina Machado）呼吁抗议活动保持和平。她说：“我们必须以和平的方式行事。我们不应陷入政府设下的挑衅陷阱。他们想让委内瑞拉人彼此对抗。” “我们的候选人赢得了70%的选票。我们团结了一个国家，曾经相信马杜罗的委内瑞拉人今天过来与我们站在一起了。” 害怕遭到安全部队报复而不愿具名的一名示威者向BBC强调，他们发现了大选舞弊证据。 他说：“我们绝对确定选举被偷走了。我在投票站工作。政府不承认这一点，他们在半夜停止了所有投票计票。他们不想让世界知道他们输了。” 示威者又解释，过去支持前领导人查韦斯（Hugo Chavez）的委内瑞拉公民，即所谓的“查维斯主义者”（Chavistas）现正在收回对现任总统马杜罗的支持。 “这是一个非常和平的抗议活动。这是加拉加斯的富人区。但我们昨天看到的情况相当暴力。我相信以前是查维斯主义者的人现在已不再是了。”示威者说。 “我认为人们都希望有所改变。情况很可能会演变成暴力冲突。” 图像来源， Reuters 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多呼吁和平示威。 抗议活动在该国全国选举委员会（CNE）主席宣布马杜罗“成功连任”第三届总统任期后爆发。这位主席是马杜罗所属政党的成员，也曾是后者的法律顾问。 委内瑞拉全国选举委员会此前宣布马杜罗以51%的得票率当选，领先于反对派埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯 （Edmundo González）的44%。 但委内瑞拉选举机构至今未公布详细的投票统计数据。因此，反对派认为大选结果存在舞弊。 美洲国家组织（OAS）指责委内瑞拉政府完全扭曲了选举结果。支持贡萨雷斯的反对派联盟说，他们已经审查了73.2%的投票统计数据，坚持认为贡萨雷斯以很大优势胜出。 图像来源， Reuters 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机的母国 “我们有记录显示我们的胜利是绝对的，在数学上是无可逆转的胜利。”贡萨雷斯对外强调。然而本周委内瑞拉全国选举委员会仍宣称所有票数均已统计完毕，结果是现任总统胜出。 此外，长期支持马杜罗的检察长塔雷克·萨布（Tarek Saab）警告称，被捕者将被指控“颠覆政府”，并且在最严重的情况下将会涉嫌“恐怖主义”。 委内瑞拉反对党“人民意志”（Popular Will）强调，现在被拘留的包括该党的全国政治协调员佛莱迪·苏帕拉诺（Freddy Superlano）。 该党又警告称，执政党政府正加强力度镇压要求政府公布投票数据的人士。 图像来源， Reuters 马杜罗的支持者也走上街头，坚称他赢得了公平的胜利。 住在佩特雷市（Patera）的朱利奥·德比斯（Julio Derbis）向BBC强调：“我们将战斗下去。我们希望通过街头压力能够推翻总统想要继续掌权的企图。” “警察是我们的邻居。我们生活在一起，他们需要明白需要加入争取所有人共同利益的战斗。” 另一名示威者卡里娜·平托（Karina Pinto）向BBC解释此次抗议与之前的反政府示威不同。 她说：“我们必须走上街头，因为这是唯一的方式。我们不支持暴力，但政府很暴力。我们必须作出回应。 “安全部队必须站在我们这一边，他们也是委内瑞拉人。他们不能反对我们，因为我们跟她们一样都是人民。” 不过在该市内另一个区域，马杜罗总统的支持者也聚集在街头，坚称他公平获胜。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 一名支持者南希·拉蒙斯（Nancy Ramones）说：“我没有在抗议任何事情，我在支持我的政府，就是那个获胜的政府。尼古拉斯·马杜罗总统。我支持他，因为他是代表和平的人。” “反对派说的那些都没有证据。如果他们说选举存在舞弊就必须证明。事实上没有发生任何舞弊。反对派总是有一些隐藏的政治目的。” “这是我们不会允许的政变，因为我们是爱国者。我们是委内瑞拉人，我们热爱和平。”拉蒙斯说。 另一位民众米拉格罗斯·亚罗查（Milagros Arocha）向BBC强调：“在这里，真正获胜的是尼古拉斯·马杜罗。这里是代表尼古拉斯·马杜罗的人。我们要和平。” 在普遍的不满情绪中，委内瑞拉反对党已经团结一致支持贡萨雷斯参选，试图在马杜罗执政11年之后推翻他的政府。 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机困扰的委内瑞拉。 联合国人权事务高级专员沃可·特尔克（Volker Turk）表示，他对委内瑞拉日益紧张和暴力的局势深感担忧。他呼吁当局尊重所有委内瑞拉人和平集会和抗议的权利。",

    "description": "彼得·鲍尔（Peter Ball）和劳拉·加西亚（Laura Garcia） BBC国际部记者，巴黎报道 14 分钟前 桥下走道上摆放着棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 2024年奥运会的目标不仅是一场体育盛会，也是主办城市巴黎的可持续发展和复兴。但该计划受到活动人士的质疑，他们声称当局一直在强迫脆弱的移民和无家可归者离开街道，并将他们驱散到法国各地。 在巴黎一座横跨运河的桥下，坐落着数十个巨大而棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 活动人士表示，这些石块的用途是在2024年奥运会期间，让流浪者和移民远离街头。 法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”（Paris Solidarity Bar）的奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）说：“今天，街上再也没有人了。” “你可以看到桥下的这些石块。”她指着一片片混凝土块补充道。“警察会来巡逻，以免移民们回来重新搭建营地。” 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）为法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”工作。 大约在奥运会开幕式前一周，一群流浪者从这里搬走。这是奥运会开幕前几个月当局清理的一长串据点和营地中最新的一处。 法雷斯·阿尔卡利·优素福（Faris Al Khali Youssouf）就是受影响者之一。他是一名来自乍得的移民，他和其他大约500人住在离奥运村只有几百米远的一栋建筑里，该建筑曾经属于一家混凝土工厂。 今年4月，防暴警察对这栋楼进行了清场，居民们被告知，他们将被安排在巴黎地区或数百公里外的图卢兹市暂住。 “你不得不说，这对难民来说简直就是一场噩梦。”法雷斯说。 “这是我们所有同胞目前都在经历的事情——他们在购买地铁票时被拦下，被截住并被转移到拘留中心。” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” “难民正面临压力。” 从部署混凝土块的地方沿着运河步行几分钟后，活动人士保罗·阿劳兹（Paul Alauzy）在不同的桥下描述了另一次清场的过程。 “这里曾经有好几年都是帐篷城，有三年都有人在这里。”他指着人们曾经扎营的柱子之间的缝隙说。“到处都是帐篷，有时有100、200或300人。” 保罗为“奖牌的另一面”（Le Revers de la Médaille）组织工作。他称，在奥运会筹备期间，约有1.3万名移民离开了巴黎街头。 这是一项长期战略的一部分，活动人士认为，随着奥运会的临近，这项战略正在加速推进。 优素福表示，他在非洲国家乍得受到政治迫害后逃亡到法国。 当局已经为迁离街头的人们提供了住所，但这些住所往往是临时性的，而且远离巴黎，分布在法国各地的不同城市。 “当你把巴黎街头的人们送到很远的小城市时，他们就没有了同样的团结网络。”保罗说。 “当然，我们不希望人们呆在外面，我们希望他们有地方住。”他补充说。 “但如果你像这样驱散，而不提供长期的解决方案，你将永远无法解决问题。” 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎警察清理了优素福曾经居住过的占屋区。 他说，在巴黎为移民群体开发的大型社区之外，人们很难获得所需的支持和医疗服务，最终只能搬回首都，重新流落街头。 在之前的奥运会上也有类似的抱怨。在东京，流浪者群体抱怨说，他们被迫离开曾经露宿的公园；在里约热内卢，整个贫民窟棚户区都被清空了。 然而，巴黎当局坚持认为，让人们离开街头是改善他们生活的关键。 图像来源， Getty Images 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望——这也是我们正在与国家讨论的议题之一——能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 “据我所知，在现阶段，阻碍事情发展的是国家可以分配的财政资源。” 巴黎市政厅对BBC表示，“流浪者问题是奥运筹备工作的核心，在奥运会期间，巴黎市政厅将继续保持警惕，为弱势人群提供住宿。” 该部门还补充说：“巴黎市政府不会运用对流浪者有敌意的城市设施”。 该部门说，放置在桥下的混凝土块并不在巴黎市的土地上，而是属于邻近的卫星城欧贝维利耶（Aubervilliers）。欧贝维利耶市政当局表示，其正在使用“劝阻性”的街道设施，以防止“移民和吸毒者”回流。 活动人士保罗·阿劳齐讲述桥下移民营地如何被当局清理掉。 不过，许多活动人士仍对此深表担忧。 “对我来说，简而言之，这就是一场社会清理。”保罗说。 “你把人们赶出去，防止他们再回来，你只是把苦痛藏在地毯下，因为这只是短期的解决方案。”",

    "description": "25 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 本周一，习近平与梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆举行了会谈。 7月27日至31日，意大利总理乔治亚·梅洛尼（Giorgia Meloni）对中国进行正式访问，访问期间，她会见了中国权力排名最高的三个领导人：国家主席习近平、总理李强、人大委员长赵乐际。 在会见习近平时她表示，中国是应对全球紧张局势的“重要对话者”；会见李强后，签署了一项加强经济合作的三年行动计划。 梅洛尼是意大利右翼政治家，2022年执政后退出习近平的标志性对外政策“一带一路”倡议，此前意大利是唯一加入该倡议的G7国家。 2022年11月，梅洛尼与习近平在巴厘岛G20峰会期间进行了双边会谈；此次是她上任后首次访华。梅洛尼称，此行为了“重启”意大利与中国的关系。 做了什么，说了什么 梅洛尼带着自己8岁的女儿抵达北京开启访华行程。 上周日她与中国国务院总理李强会面，梅洛尼表示，“我很高兴来这里展开本届政府的首次正式访问，在此之前，我们已经举行了数次高级别会议，这表明了我们开启新阶段的意愿，在我们全球战略伙伴关系建立20周年之际，重新启动我们的双边合作。” 会谈后，在梅洛尼和李强的见证下，中意两国签署三年行动计划，梅洛尼称其为“尝试新的合作形式”。 北京方面声明称，此举旨在增加两国在中小型企业在造船、航空航天、新能源、人工智能等领域的互利合作。 周日晚些时候，梅洛尼和李强出席了中意商业论坛，并在论坛上宣布了六项新协议，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源等不同领域。 梅洛尼在论坛上说，意大利与中国签署了一份工业合作备忘录，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源领域，这些是“中国已经运作了一段时间的前沿技术行业……（中国）正与合作伙伴分享新的前沿知识”。 一带一路：G7唯一参与国意大利正式退出 意大利大选极右翼政党获胜 有望诞生首位女总理 “一带一路”倡议十周年 改变世界的成败与未来 图像来源， Getty Image 两国领导人会谈。 本周一，梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆与习近平会谈，她表示，“国际上不安全因素日益增多，我认为中国不可避免地成为应对所有这些情况的一个非常重要的对话者。 她说，两国必须 “共同思考”，以保持稳定和保障和平。 意大利总理办公室其后发布声明称，两国领导人讨论的问题包括乌克兰战争、中东局势进一步升级的风险以及印度洋-太平洋地区日益加剧的紧张局势，以及“从人工智能到应对气候变化和联合国安理会改革”等一些最重要的全球治理问题。 习近平则敦促罗马和北京“秉持丝绸之路精神”，使东西方关系“重回新时代”。 他说，“双方都面临着共同发展的重要机遇”，并补充说，“北京欢迎意大利企业来华投资，也愿意进口更多高质量的意大利产品”。 意大利通讯社（ANSA）报道称，习近平还表示中国有意与意大利探索在电动汽车和人工智能等新兴领域的合作。意大利是中国在欧盟的第四大贸易伙伴，该国因此仍热衷于寻求与北京建立强有力的经济关系。 在梅洛尼访问期间，两国还共同纪念意大利探险家马可·波罗逝世700周年。 值得一提的是，梅洛尼还在上述商业论坛上说：“中国在意大利的投资约为意大利在中国投资的三分之一。我希望以正确的方式缩小这一差距”。除了投资外，贸易也不平衡，去年双边贸易额达717.58亿美元，其中主要是中国对意大利的出口。 尴尬的前奏 梅洛尼访华过程中，中意双方在公开讲话和声明中，绝口不提“一带一路”倡议。只有习近平在会谈时表示，“中国和意大利分处古丝绸之路两端”，“弘扬丝路精神”，但未直接谈及中国雄心勃勃的“一带一路”倡议。 2019年，意大利成为第一个签署“一带一路”倡议的七国集团国家，这引起了美国和其他欧洲国家的担忧，认为这可能导致中国控制关键技术和基础设施。 然而，彼时在野的梅洛尼长期以来一直对“一带一路”倡议持批评态度，梅洛尼称其为 “一个大错误”。2022年梅洛尼上台，2023年12月正式通知中国政府将于年底退出该倡议。 投资银行“那提西银行”（Natixis）亚太区首席经济学家阿莉西亚·加西亚·埃雷罗（Alicia Garcia-Herrero）向媒体表示，“每个加入（一带一路倡议）的国家都知道，中国是第一位的，而他们是第二位的，我不认为意大利作为七国集团（G7）成员希望与俄罗斯、巴基斯坦或斯里兰卡被归为一类。” 她补充说：“如果没有‘一带一路倡议’（成员资格），梅洛尼与中国的接触就会处于不同的层次——不再是附庸，而是合作伙伴。” 不过，当时许多意大利公司担心中国政府可能会采取报复行动，影响它们在中国的投资或者与中国的贸易。 不仅如此，梅洛尼上台后还阻止一家中国国有企业控制轮胎制造巨头倍耐力（Pirelli）。 图像来源， Getty Images 中国的国有化工巨头中化集团是倍耐力的最大股东，持有这家拥有151年历史的米兰公司37%的股份。 去年六月，倍耐力在一份致投资者的声明中对外表示，意大利政府已裁定，只有倍耐力老板马尔科·特隆切蒂·普罗维拉（Marco Tronchetti Provera）控制的卡姆芬公司（Camfin）才能提名首席执行官候选人。 倍耐力还表示，政府已决定，该公司针对公司治理的任何变化都应接受官方审查。 在最近中国和欧盟的贸易摩擦中，意大利也支持欧盟委员会提高对中国进口电动车关税的决策。 早在2008年，梅洛尼作为已故总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼（Silvio Berlusconi）政府的青年部长，她曾敦促意大利运动员抵制2008年北京奥运会开幕式，以抗议中国的人权记录，尤其是在西藏的人权问题。 外界认为，这些都成为与中国改善关系过程中的阻碍。 重启之路 但中国有可能不计前嫌，跟意大利修补关系——路透社表示，意大利对中国具有重要的战略意义，因为该国以前曾独自与中国进行过合作，并可能成为欧盟、G7等集团内部一个对华温和的声音。 曾倡导罗马在2019年加入“一带一路”倡议的意大利前政府官员米歇尔·杰拉奇（Michele Geraci）说，中国政府可能也会渴望摆脱最近的挫折。 “中国的目标是假装一切顺利，&quot;他说。“他们对强调意大利退出‘一带一路’倡议并无太大兴趣。他们不喜欢这样，不喜欢大惊小怪。” 图像来源， Getty Image 中意两国国旗 梅洛尼的公开发言似乎表明，意大利也有意向中国靠拢，并成为中国在欧盟中的朋友之一。梅洛尼称，“我认为，意大利也可以在（中国）与欧盟的关系中发挥重要作用，并在此尝试建立尽可能平衡的贸易关系。” 路透社表示，虽然意大利去年迫于美国压力最终退出“一带一路”，但罗马在周日签署了一项为期三年的行动计划，表明它仍希望与这个亚洲巨人建立更牢固的贸易关系。 中国国际问题研究院欧洲研究所所长崔洪建说，面对地缘政治的不确定性，包括美国大选带来的不确定性，中国的首要任务是稳定两国关系。中方告诉意方“我们需要在两国关系中增加一些韧性”。 但这并不意味着重启关系之路会一帆风顺。梅洛尼本人一直对中国持警惕态度，对中国的人权问题直言不讳，还指责中国的不公平贸易行为，并警告欧洲在战略供应链中过度依赖中国公司可能带来风险。 即便是气氛颇为友好的访华之旅期间，她在上述商业论坛上，对企业高管们说，“显然，我们不能掩盖严重失衡的问题，这对意大利来说是一个重要的逆差”，并提到了改善中国市场准入和加强知识产权保护的必要性。 李强在会面时也表示，“希望欧盟客观看待中国的发展......深化对话与合作”，“保护主义无法保护竞争力”。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/sports-69230112",
    "description": "詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James FitzGerald） 巴黎报道 1 小时前 图像来源， EPA 这本该是2024年巴黎奥运会的一大亮点：铁人三项运动员在塞纳河中竞逐，让游泳回归巴黎市中心。但出于对水质的担忧，首场比赛不得不推迟一天进行。 我们来到原计划起点稍下游的荣军院桥（Pont des Invalides）上，当地人和游客向我谈起他们是否想亲自下水游泳。 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 “这是一条美丽的河流。”在七月的炎热日子里，巴黎人赫达（Reda）看着塞纳河波光粼粼的水面说道。 “但我永远不会潜入水中，即便他们清理了很多年。” 塞纳河已经在本届奥运会中成为主角。在上周五晚淅淅沥沥的雨中举行的开幕式上，塞纳河接待了数以千计参加游船巡游的运动员。 一个世纪以来，由于水质问题，当局一直禁止市民在塞纳河中游泳。但通过一项大型改造项目，在塞纳河里畅游将成为本届奥运会的重要遗产之一。 就在本周一，组织者还表示他们有信心铁人三项比赛将按计划进行。但周末的大雨使这一计划落空。 巴黎的“单一系统”排水设施已经饱和，来自厨房、厕所和街道上的雨水等额外水源被排入河中。 巴黎人赫达说自己永远不会潜入塞纳河水中。 巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）最近在塞纳河中游泳，以强调为清洁塞纳河所做的努力。 此前的检测结果显示，塞纳河中的大肠杆菌水平超过了体育协会规定的上限。这种细菌可导致呕吐和腹泻等疾病。 BBC记者休·肖菲尔德（Hugh Schofield）当时也加入了伊达尔戈的行列。他不小心吞下一口河水，但他说水的味道还不错。 我在荣军院桥上与许多游客交谈时，他们都说在本国露天水域游泳并非难事。 来自英国、德国、荷兰和捷克的游客都表示，他们曾在本国的河流、湖泊和运河中游泳，如果有证据表明塞纳河是安全的，他们也会这么做。 埃斯米（右）表示，这条河看上去“没有那么糟糕”。 “我愿意试试。”来自荷兰的女士埃斯米（Esmee）说，“从这里看并没有那么糟糕。” 法国在优质浴场水质方面落后于欧盟平均水平。根据欧洲环境署（European Environment Agency）的数据，2023年约有75%的法国浴场水质被评为优，而整个欧盟的这一比例为85%。 该机构在今年5月发布的报告中指出，虽然在欧盟的大多数浴场游泳都是安全的，但沿海水域的游泳条件普遍优于河流和湖泊。 塞浦路斯以97.6%的浴场水质优良率位居榜首，其次是奥地利的96.9%和克罗地亚的96.7%。 由于该数据只针对欧盟国家，因此不包括英国。尽管塞纳河已开始允许游泳，但目前英国只有泰晤士河的一个河段——牛津郡瓦灵福德附近——被指定为游泳场所。 欧洲环境署特别提到了巴黎10年前开始的耗资14亿欧元（11亿英镑；15 亿美元）的清理行动。 作为这项行动的一部分，巴黎建造了一个巨大的雨水蓄集池。它可以储存相当于20个奥林匹克游泳池的水量。这是阻止污水在暴雨期间流入塞纳河的机制的一部分。 丹妮勒表示，她期待着在这条著名的河流中畅游。 在男子铁人三项比赛前夕，并非所有来到大桥的游客都对清洁问题感到困扰。一些人表示，只要天气足够暖和，无论如何他们都会考虑跳进河里。 一位来自巴西的男子说，他和他的同胞就是这么做的。他承认：“在我的城市圣保罗，河水也不干净。” 但许多巴黎人都认为，一条干净、适于游泳的河流将成为奥运遗产中令人兴奋的一部分。 大学教授丹妮勒（Danielle）说，她“绝对会”在塞纳河中游泳。 “我早就想这么做了。”她笑着说。 对于一个名叫达米安（Damien）的男子来说，保持塞纳河的清洁是一项“大工程”，但值得一做。 “这对所有巴黎人来说都是一个好机会。”他说。 目前，塞纳河的水质每天都会被进行检测。 2024年巴黎奥运会运营总监兰比斯·康斯坦丁尼蒂斯（Lambis Konstantinidis）说，目前有若干备用计划，包括使用补赛日。 他在星期一对BBC说，只有在“非常、非常极端的情况下”，才会考虑将铁人三项赛降级为铁人二项，并完全取消游泳比赛。 劳伦·特纳（Lauren Turner）补充报道",

His wife, who is eight months pregnant, said her husband was not told why he was being detained and that officers assumed he was on a visa – but actually he has a green card, allowing him to stay in the US and protecting his constitutional rights. Khalil says his detention is part of a crackdown on dissent – and to deter others from protesting. During pro-Palestine protests on the Columbia campus last year he acted as a mediator between the university and the demonstrators, and, unlike many students, left his face uncovered.

    "description": "It looks like Meta’s campaign to bury a dishy, tell-all memoir from a former employee isn’t exactly working. In fact, it seems that the company’s legal maneuvers to block the book have had the exact opposite intended effect. Careless People has debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. It’s also spent much of the week in the number three position on Amazon’s bestseller list . That’s despite the fact that Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former policy director at Facebook, has been barred from promoting or publicly discussing the book following legal action by Meta. The memoir details much of the inner workings of Facebook during the nearly seven years Wynn-Williams worked there. It reveals new details about the company’s relentless ambition to bring the social network to China, as well as numerous shocking stories about how Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and other executives behaved behind closed doors. (In addition to her revelations in Careless People , Wynn-Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Committee. That complaint has not been made public, but according to NBC News , she alleges that Facebook “misled” investors.) Meta has come out forcefully against Wynn-Williams and the book, describing it in a statement as “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives.” The company says Wynn-Williams was fired in 2017 “for poor performance and toxic behavior.” Meta initiated arbitration proceedings against Wynn-Williams last week, resulting in a decision that for now prevents her from publicly discussing or promoting the work. But, as the bestseller lists show, the move has done little to kill interest in the work.

    "description": "Hasbro&#39;s Wizards of the Coast has laid off 30 people who built Sigil , its recently released virtual tabletop experience, Polygon reports . The app allows Dungeons &amp; Dragons players to build virtual, 3D game boards, complete with miniatures and dice, so they can play the classic tabletop roleplaying game remotely. News of the layoffs were first shared on March 18 in a LinkedIn post from Andy Collins , the design lead on Sigil. &quot;Today, approximately 30 talented developers (90 percent of the team) were laid off from the Sigil (virtual tabletop) team at Wizards of the Coast, including yours truly,&quot; Collins wrote. &quot;I wish my former colleagues success in their future endeavors. I&#39;ll also be pulling for the crew left behind who&#39;ll do their best to keep improving and iterating the experience we shipped last month.&quot; The layoffs leave Sigil with a skeleton crew of three people to support the app, Rascal reports . Sigil launched in early access on February 28, 2025 as a perk for subscribers to D&amp;D Beyond, and early reviews found it to be both limited and a little broken. The problems may have started even earlier, though, according to at least one Wizards of the Coast employee Rascal spoke to. Management at Hasbro, the parent company of Wizards of the Coast, were reportedly uninterested and &quot;constantly moving goalposts.&quot; There may have also been a fundamental misunderstanding over what Sigil was: Hasbro didn&#39;t know the difference between a video game and the VTT (virtual tabletop) app it ultimately got. Sigil remains live and will continue to be a perk of paying for a D&amp;D Beyond subscription, Wizards of the Coast&#39;s tool for playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons virtually.

    "description": "Boston Dynamics has treated us to a lot of impressive videos over the years and the company is back today with the latest example of its robotics mastery. In the clip above, its Atlas robot demonstrates several types of full-body movement, starting with a walk and advancing to a cartwheel and even a spot of break dancing. The different actions were developed using reinforcement learning that used motion capture and animation as source materials. At this rate, our future robot overlords will be able to out-dance and out-tumble us humans as well as out-think us one day. The video is part of Boston Dynamics&#39; research with the Robotics and AI Institute, but it has multiple partners aiding its work. For instance, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang touched on the company&#39;s GR00T model for robotics during the GTC 2025 keynote earlier this week. Yesterday, Boston Dynamics announced that it is deepening its collaboration with the company focused on AI in robotics. It is using NVIDIA&#39;s Jetson Thor computing platform to run &quot;complex, multimodal AI models that work seamlessly with Boston Dynamics’ whole-body and manipulation controllers.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/watch-the-atlas-robot-bust-a-move-in-boston-dynamics-latest-video-211329951.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Spry Fox announced its next game, which is &quot;a cooperative village life sim designed to foster friendship, kindness, and community&quot; titled Spirit Crossing. It has an art style that makes me think of a pastel-hued Spirited Away , especially given the presence of moody spectres hanging out in the quaint town setting. The teaser trailer also shows players engaged in classic cozy game activities such as giving gifts, fishing, coasting on hang gliders and riding very floofy critters. In other words: I&#39;ll be playing a lot of Spirit Crossing when it launches. There&#39;s no definite timeline yet, but Netflix said at GDC that the game is part of its 2025 mobile release slate. Spry Fox dabbled in several different genres, including several mobile puzzle games with a signature style such as Alphabear and Triple Town , before settling into a groove creating cozy games. Spirit Crossing will be the studio&#39;s second project since joining the Netflix Games roster; Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit came out last summer. Players who want in on the ground floor of the devs&#39; latest game can sign up now for closed alpha testing.

    "description": "Verizon has announced that it will now support sending text messages via satellite on phones from the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 lineup. Both Google and Samsung&#39;s current phones support satellite connectivity, but neither has really leveraged the skill outside of the Satellite SOS feature that was added to Android 15. Sending texts via satellite will be available when Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 phones are &quot;outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks,&quot; Verizon says, and should come with same limitations as other satellite tools, like the need to position yourself so that there&#39;s no large structures or tree cover getting between your phone and the sky. It&#39;s also worth noting: the necessary changes &quot;enabling this service start today and will continue over the next two weeks,&quot; so you might want to wait a bit longer before you start your next off-grid adventure. Apple introduced Messages via Satellite alongside iOS 18, which doesn&#39;t rely on carriers for support, but should offer a good illustration of how Verizon&#39;s satellite messaging will work when it&#39;s fully available on the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25.&nbsp; The carrier is partnered with satellite provider AST SpaceMobile for its expanding list of satellite-connected services, and the companies have experimented with even more demanding communication options, like video calls. Competitors like T-Mobile already offer satellite messaging through a partnership with SpaceX&#39;s Starlink .

    "description": "Google has followed up an ocean&#39;s worth of leaks with the official announcement of its Pixel 9a smartphone, which will retail for $499. Possibly the biggest change to the new A-series model is in its appearance, with the removal of the camera bar on the back of the phone. In the 9a, the camera housing is &quot;slightly domed,&quot; sitting nearly flush with the rest of the frame, giving this midrange model a sleeker appearance. There are also new colors for this series — a pale purple dubbed Iris and a vibrant pink named Peony — joining the usual Porcelain and Obsidian options. (The peony option is similar to that on the pricier Pixel 9 .) Our senior reviewer Sam Rutherford has already been able to check out the new device in person, and you can read why he thinks the Pixel 9a might be &quot;the new midrange smartphone king. &quot; But here&#39;s the details before you head over to his impressions. In addition to what&#39;s already been covered here, the Pixel 9a is also getting a chip upgrade, moving up to Google&#39;s Tensor G4 processor from the G3 that was in Google&#39;s excellent Pixel 8a . Performance in the 8a was already quite good, so expect even smoother control with the G4. As with the 8a, the 9a is equipped with 8GB of RAM and comes with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. The new A-series also promises up to &quot;30+ hour battery life.&quot; Cameras were a big reason why we liked the Pixel 8a, naming it our top pick for a midrange smartphone . The housing is different in the 9a, but it&#39;s also got slightly different specs inside. The rear dual cameras in the 9a offer 48MP wide and 13MP ultrawide lenses, while the front is equipped with a 13MP selfie camera; the 8a had 64MP wide in the rear camera. It&#39;ll support AI-powered features such as Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Best Take and Photo Unblur. Google is bringing the Macro Focus option to the A-series for the first time for photos with lots of close-up details. There&#39;s also Night Sight to help improve your nocturnal photography.&nbsp; It is worth noting that since the announcement, Ars Technica has reported that because the Pixel 9a ships with 8GB of RAM, it&#39;s &quot;forced to&quot; rely on an &quot;extra extra small&quot; model of Gemini AI. The article also notes that this means &quot;some of Google&#39;s coolest AI features don&#39;t work on the 9a.&quot; The 9a will be available in the US and Canada in North America, as well as numerous other countries in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Google says the device will be available in April, with no further detail on specific timing. Update, March 19 2025, 12:16PM ET: This story has been updated to correct the last sentence, which said pre-orders would open in April. There will be no pre-orders. Update, March 19 2025, 3:27PM ET: This story has been updated to add a paragraph informing readers of our hands-on of the Pixel 9a, as well as another paragraph about an Ars Technica report on limited AI features.

    "description": "It&#39;s unlikely that the fate of a company as large as Ubisoft will hinge on the success of one tentpole single-player game. But the company cannot afford another major error anytime soon after the likes of Star Wars: Outlaws and XDefiant &nbsp; failed to set the world alight. Ubisoft desperately needs a big hit (and for the Rainbow Six Siege X overhaul to go well). The good news for the company is that Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows is poised to deliver on that. On the surface, it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect: a massive Assassin&#39;s Creed game that takes dozens of hours to beat. There&#39;s so much to do beyond the core story, given all the missions and sidequests that the game constantly points you towards. I was rarely bored during my time with the game — not even during the lengthy flashbacks — which says a lot about the care and consideration Ubisoft&#39;s developers have put into this giant world and the story that ties it together. Ubisoft could not risk having the game run poorly from the jump and then spend months fixing it à la Cyberpunk 2077 . Thankfully, for the most part, Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows runs well across my consoles (base PS5 and Xbox Series X) and PC. It looks sumptuous on my high-end gaming rig, which has an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 14th-gen i9 Intel CPU and 32GB of RAM. I had zero issues while running everything at very high settings. The action hovered in the 55-59 fps range with no considerable framerate drops — save for the slightly jarring switch to cutscenes, which play out at 30 fps. It&#39;s worth noting that Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows is verified for Steam Deck, but I wasn&#39;t able to test it out there. There were no noticeable slowdowns even in the heat of chaotic combat on the three platforms I played on. However, I did spot some small visual aberrations on PS5. Early on, while strolling through puddles in performance mode, water pooling on a dirt track shimmered in an unnatural way. It distracted me from the conversation I was having with an ally. Ubisoft Once I was in winter, textures on the grass that poked through the snow faded out and in while I tore through the countryside on horseback. For the record, that happened in balanced mode, which attempts to split the difference between the quality and performance modes in terms of visual fidelity versus framerate. These are minor complaints, in fairness, but they momentarily broke the immersion for me. The main other weird quirk is that my horse often got stuck when I whistled for it. If, say, I was on a narrow bridge when I called the steed, it might spawn into the river below. A slight annoyance that&#39;s more to do with how the horse is programmed to catch up to you by your side, but one that&#39;s forgivable considering some of the many narrow paths you&#39;ll venture along. Two heroes with their own stories The big hook this time around is that you can swap between two characters almost whenever you like. Naoe, a shinobi, is a more traditional Assassin&#39;s Creed protagonist, while the warrior Yasuke is a hulking samurai who can bust through doors and carry bodies to hiding spots more easily than his counterpart. There are missions and character interactions that require you to specifically play as one character, but for the most part, you can play as either in the open world. I stuck to Naoe as much as I could. She&#39;s far more nimble and capable at clambering around strongholds — her grappling hook is such a handy tool — and carrying out stealthy assassinations. After all, she’s the only one of the two who has the fabled hidden blade. Her movement is extremely fluid, an aspect of the game that&#39;s said to have benefited from the extra time developers had amid its delays . Unlike Yasuke, Naoe can use the classic eagle vision ability to reveal enemies, hiding spots and goodies through walls. She&#39;s plenty capable in hand-to-hand combat as well, more so as you unlock abilities like the very useful double assassination. Her kusarigama , which consists of a sickle-like implement and heavy weight linked by a chain, is a great part of her arsenal. That&#39;s not to say Yasuke isn&#39;t a fun character as well. Silently thinning out enemy numbers with his bow or loudly with a teppō firearm before charging in to eliminate the remainder with a long katana, crushing club and special moves like booting a grunt into a wall never got old. Both protagonists are well-written and performed, at least while playing with English audio. However, the lip syncing didn&#39;t always neatly match up with what the characters were saying, a distraction in cutscenes. While I didn&#39;t get around to playing the game in immersive mode, with characters speaking in their native tongues of Japanese and Portuguese, I&#39;d be interested to see if the lip sync issue is as prominent there. Personal stakes with a broader goal Nevertheless, the story was strong enough to hold my attention during the cutscenes and the rest of the game. It&#39;s a tale that starts with very personal stakes for both heroes but expands to involve safeguarding the future of Japan. The writers have crafted a narrative with plenty of intrigue and intricacy, and I enjoyed how they weaved the broader Assassin&#39;s Creed lore into Shadows. I would say the story and structure are rich and intricate enough to justify the 40-60 hours it&#39;ll take many people to finish this game. (The new scouting system — which you&#39;ll use to narrow down the location of an objective after learning that, for instance, a target is in a specific area — works well.) Still, I preferred the tighter 20-hour approach Ubisoft took with Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage . Ubisoft I enjoyed playing in canon mode, which removed dialogue choices and let narrative beats play out as the designers intended. It&#39;s too much of a spoiler to reveal how Naoe and Yasuke come to be allies, but the interactions between them and other characters, particularly the flirty relationship Naoe has with one firearm-wielding figure, are for the most part captivating enough. The performers (and, my goodness, are there a lot of speaking parts here) by and large do a great job with the material. But it&#39;s a bit jarring to hear a character speak in a plain North American accent when most of the cast bring Japanese and Portuguese inflections to their delivery. As solid as the tale being told is overall, the structure is a little odd in places. The main story includes flashback sequences, including one with a combat tutorial that takes place right after the action-packed prologue, that disrupt the flow even if they add some color to the protagonists&#39; backstories. Skill tree frustrations I&#39;m not a big fan of the way Ubisoft has structured the progression systems. Naoe and Yasuke each have six skill trees, all of which are broken down into levels. To unlock the next level, the player has to accumulate enough experience points by completing various side activities, including horse archery and finding hidden items dotted around temples. In a vacuum, these can be fun, but it gets a little frustrating when you have a lot of spare mastery points to spend on skills and you have to run around to honor some shrines or find meditation spots before you&#39;re able to acquire some of Naoe&#39;s and Yasuke&#39;s cooler moves. There are some other antiquated systems in the game. Defeating a rōnin — a samurai who has been hired to take out the heroes — in a fun fight earned me decent loot, including some legendary light armor. But I couldn&#39;t equip it, because my character hadn&#39;t quite reached a high enough level to simply put on some new rags. This doesn&#39;t make any logical sense. Scaling enemy difficulty from region to region, a trope that Ubisoft eschewed in Mirage, feels very tired here too. It&#39;s an artificial way of ramping up the difficulty and progression when other approaches like more creative level design, new enemy types and the player manually making the game harder in their settings can do the trick. Given the historical nature of the series, it does follow to a degree that some of Ubisoft’s gameplay ideas are stuck in the past. In general, I don&#39;t really care to spend my time scouring for gear upgrades just so I can stand a chance in a new area. That said, perks on certain equipment can come in handy. Skulking around castles to take out a few key enemies to unlock a chest with some valuable equipment felt rewarding — even just as a little something extra to do while I tried to make my way to a viewpoint on enemy turf. Castles are valuable strongholds and offer a defensive advantage against attackers, so it&#39;s only logical that the bad guys would be stationed around viewpoints, which reveal new points of interest visible to our heroes after they scale up to a specific perch. Ubisoft Even without that gameplay aspect, scaling up to a viewpoint is always worth it, as has long been the case in the Assassin&#39;s Creed series. The minimum reward is a sweeping shot of the surrounding area, and since Shadows is such a stunner, I made it a point to claim every viewpoint along my path. The aforementioned puddle and grass anomalies aside, it’s a joy to roam around this gorgeous game, with its abundant foliage, carefully assembled settlements and dynamic weather system combining to form a rich, lived-in world that I won&#39;t soon forget. The lighting systems allowing for Naoe and Yaskue to snuff out candles and lanterns to help them hide in the shadows at night were a smart addition here too. There are plenty of other fun aspects to Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows . In one moment that reminded me of a beat in The Last of Us Part II , I was just starting a peaceful side activity when an assassin tried to take me out. That was an enjoyably unexpected twist. Meanwhile, an optional fight against a high-level enemy at the foot of a blazing tower in the middle of the night felt deeply cinematic. There are often moments of serenity, such as those meditations and drinking in the scenery from the viewpoints, as well as Naoe&#39;s preparations for a tea ceremony that plays an important part in the plot. Simply wandering through a forest and encountering harmless animals as the wind stirs up golden brown leaves in the fall can be calming too.&nbsp; That contrasts with the game&#39;s abundant, brutal violence. Beyond the many quick murders you&#39;ll commit with a flash of Naoe&#39;s hidden blade, several of Yasuke&#39;s kill animations end with him lopping off heads and limbs. The game&#39;s truly peaceful moments deftly balance that out. There&#39;s a lot riding on Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows . Ubisoft will absolutely be hoping that it&#39;s a success out of the gates and that not too many players wait for the price to drop. There&#39;s plenty of competition to be concerned about too, particularly as Sucker Punch Productions&#39; sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yōtei , is slated to arrive at some point this year. It does feel like there&#39;s enough here to draw in both Assassin&#39;s Creed diehards and newcomers who may be entranced by the 16th-century Japan setting but don’t know their Animus from their elbow. Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows has impressive technical work, great performances and an expansive, well-drawn story but it&#39;s unfortunately weighed down by some frustrating decisions and antiquated gameplay systems. Still, I&#39;m eager to keep exploring. Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Mac, Amazon Luna and Ubisoft+ on March 20. It will be available for iPad in the future.

    "description": "Streaming service Plex is raising its prices for the first time in ten years . The company just announced an increase for its premium subscription service Plex Pass, which offers a number of additional features like offline access and themes. The standard service is still free, if you’re looking to set up a simple media server to stream some movies or shows. Plex Pass will soon cost $7 per month, which is an increase of $2 per month. A yearly subscription will come in at $70, a fairly substantial lift from $40. Finally, the coveted lifetime pass is shooting up to $250 from $120. These are some serious upticks, but I guess that’s what happens when you don’t raise prices for a decade. The changes go into effect on April 29, so the Plex-curious still have more than a month to pick up a lifetime pass at the original $120 asking price. The monthly and yearly price impacts both new and pre-existing customers. The company says it&#39;s doing this to keep up with rising industry costs. Remote streaming is also set to fall under a subscription, albeit a cheaper one at $2 per month.&nbsp; &quot;These changes weren’t made lightly, and we’ve spent a lot of time weighing the best path forward to ensure we can continue to balance value with a best-in-class personal media experience for years to come,&quot; a blog post from the company says.&nbsp; However, there are some new tools coming to accompany these price increases. It’s integrating with Common Sense Media to bring ratings and reviews aimed at parents to Plex Pass holders. It’s also working on a new server management app that will launch in the near(ish) future. The primary playback is also getting a much-needed refresh . The platform is eliminating the mobile unlock fee, which is a one-time activation fee that was required to remove the one-minute playback limitation when streaming content from a media server to a mobile device. Recently, Plex added public reviews and profiles . The Plex Pass price increase comes as the entire streaming industry begins tightening its belt. Just about every platform has gotten more expensive in the last couple of years .

    "description": "The EU is moving forward with competition-based regulatory actions against Google and Apple. The European Commission (EC) announced two preliminary charges against Google for failing to comply with Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulations related to Google Search and the Play Store, which could lead to fines of $35 billion. The regulatory body also ordered Apple to make iOS more open to third-party devices like smartwatches, headphones and TVs. The decisions come in the face of US President Donald Trump threatening additional tariffs on nations that regulate US Big Tech companies. As part of an investigation that began last March , the EC charged Google on Tuesday with violating the DMA by favoring its own services (such as shopping, hotel booking, transportation and financial and sports results) in search results over third-party competitors. The regulators said the company gives its services &quot;more prominent treatment compared to others&quot; by displaying them with enhanced visual formats and filtering mechanisms. The EC also charged the company with preventing Google Play app developers from informing customers of alternative channels for cheaper offers. Although the commission said Alphabet has a right to charge a developer fee for steering a customer to another channel, it claimed that what the company demands in return goes beyond what is justified — &quot;a high fee over an unduly long period of time for every purchase of digital goods and services.&quot; &quot;The two preliminary findings we adopt today aim to ensure that Alphabet abides by EU rules when it comes to two services widely used by businesses and consumers across the EU, Google Search and Android phones,&quot; EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement. The European Commission European Union The DMA, which was passed in 2022, allows European regulators to fine companies up to 10 percent of their global revenue. The commission can double the penalty to 20 percent for repeat offenders. Alphabet brought in over $350 billion last year. The commission stresses that the charges aren&#39;t final, and Alphabet can still defend its decisions in writing before they are finalized. The EU&#39;s moves follow through on a recent promise to enforce its regulatory laws despite tariff threats from Trump as part of his escalating trade war with other nations. He wrote a memo in late February, saying he would consider tariffs in response to &quot;digital services taxes, fines, practices and policies&quot; on American companies. In turn, the EC said it would &quot;respond swiftly and decisively to defend its rights and regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures.&quot; Kara Durrette via Getty Images Although the EC&#39;s decision for Apple doesn&#39;t (yet) involve charges, it offered measures the company must comply with to avoid them in the future. First, the company must provide greater compatibility with third-party devices that connect to iPhones. Unless Apple wants to face fines of over $39 billion, it will have to improve areas like notifications for third-party smartwatches, data transfer speeds (like peer-to-peer Wi-Fi and NFC) and the pairing process on connected accessories from competing companies. The EC also ordered Apple to improve access to technical documentation for developers to make their products interact with iPhones and iPads. &quot;Effective interoperability for third-party connected devices is an important step towards opening Apple&#39;s ecosystem,&quot; Ribera said in a statement. &quot;This will lead to a better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eus-new-charges-against-google-could-lead-to-at-least-35-billion-in-fines-165850585.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple just introduced its first proprietary cellular modem, the C1, as part of the recently-launched iPhone 16e . Ookla, the company behind Speedtest, just ran the C1 modem through a series of benchmark tests and it did surprisingly well, even when compared to the Qualcomm chips that accompany the pricier iPhone 16 handsets. The C1 misses out on mmWave 5G support, but can still hold its own in the speed department. The company found that the iPhone 16e offered average download speeds of 560Mbps for the top 90th percentile of users on AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile. The standard iPhone 16, with the Qualcomm chip, is faster in this scenario, with average download speed of 756Mbps. The difference, however, isn’t stark. Ookla Things change when you move from the top 90th percentile to the bottom 10th percentile. In this case, the iPhone 16e actually outperforms the standard model. The average data speed for the 16e here reached nearly 218Mbps, whereas the Qualcomm-based model averaged 210Mbps. Interestingly, the newest iPhone model was fastest when using AT&amp;T and Verizon’s networks. It was slower on T-Mobile. As for upload speeds, the 16e outperformed the traditional iPhone 16 in nearly every test. Apple has touted the C1 as the “most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone,” and that doesn’t seem to be hyperbole. Ookla’s tests match our experience, as detailed in the official iPhone 16e review . We found that the C1 modem outperformed even the iPhone 16 Pro in certain use cases. However, it’s always worth noting that this chip doesn’t support ultrawideband 5G. So Apple’s investment to build an in-house modem looks to have been a worthy endeavor, just like those speedy M-series chips. The company reportedly has big plans for future iterations. Not only is the C2 likely on the way, but Apple is planning on creating an all-purpose processor that contains an integrated modem . This could allow for some serious energy and cost benefits.

    "description": "Skate Story has been one of my most anticipated games ever since I first clapped eyes on it all the way back in 2020 , so it was great to get an update on it as part of Sony&#39;s annual PS Indie Day. It&#39;s been confirmed that the striking skateboarding adventure is coming to PS5, as well as PC. Publisher Devolver Digital plans to release it later this year. Solo developer Sam Eng describes Skate Story as &quot;a game about a demon made of glass who needs to skate the Underworld and consume The Moon to fulfill the devil’s contract.&quot; To achieve that, you&#39;ll need to work your way through nine layers of hell. The only way to beat bosses is by skating fast and pulling off an array of dope tricks, which deal damage. There&#39;s a time limit on the boss battle against the Moon that&#39;s shown in the latest trailer — you only have until a song ends to defeat the celestial body. There are more than 70 tricks for you to learn and improve, and you&#39;ll level up by completing skate trials. Other characters you&#39;ll encounter include a &quot;pillowy demon who owns a laundromat&quot; and a &quot;jittery subway train&quot; you can become pals with and then &quot;experience poetry about the multilight of the Moon.&quot; As odd as that all sounds, absolutely everything I&#39;ve seen and heard about Skate Story has hit the right spot for me. I especially can&#39;t get enough of those visuals. Eng promises to reveal more details about Skate Story this summer. Given that Devolver typically runs a showcase alongside Summer Game Fest, we&#39;ll probably hear more about the game in early June. In the meantime, you can get a taste of what&#39;s in store by checking out our Skate Story hands-on .

    "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+ and Hulu, Audible, Max and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it (eventually? maybe?) drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This Amazon Spring Sale deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. The deal runs through April 30. Paramount+ student discount - 50 percent off any plan: Ahead of March Madness , students can get half off any Paramount+ plan through April 8. To get the discount, scroll to the bottom of the Paramount+ homepage and click &quot;Get a 50% discount&quot; next to &quot;Are you a student?&quot; CBS shares broadcast rights with Warner Bros. Discovery this year for the men&#39;s tournament, so you&#39;ll be able to catch games on Paramount+ if you have the subscription tier that includes Showtime. Starz (six months) for $18 ($28 off): Starz&#39;s latest offer gives you six months of access for only $18, which shakes out to about $3 per month. This represents a 61-percent discount off the standard &quot;semi-annual&quot; plan, which puts six months of access up for $46. To get the offer, go to the Starz website and click on &quot;claim special offer.&quot; You&#39;ll have to provide your email address before the discounted rates appear. As an alternative, you could opt for the monthly plan discount, which is currently $3 per month for a total of three months. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Fubo Essential for $50/month for the first month ($35 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Sling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you&#39;ll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you&#39;ll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange &amp; Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month : This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

    "description": "There is something so incredibly frustrating about typing on a digital keyboard with a controller. Whether for streaming or gaming, the slowness with which you often have to find each letter is just painful. Well, thankfully, there&#39;s an improvement on the way for Xbox controllers , with Microsoft announcing a new gamepad keyboard for Windows 11&#39;s touch keyboard.&nbsp; Microsoft The updated keyboard should make it easier to use the on-screen one with an Xbox controller. It brings greater navigation to the controller and helpful shortcuts. For example, the X button can function as backspace, the Y button as the spacebar and the menu button as enter. Microsoft also states that it has vertically aligned the keyboard keys for smoother use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft first shared that it was beta testing this technology back in September . Now, it&#39;s available in the Release Preview version of Windows 11, so you should be able to try it out for yourself within the next few weeks. Hopefully it saves you a lot of time and frustration (and that streamers will come up with their own solutions soon).&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-launches-a-new-gamepad-keyboard-layout-for-windows-11-154011591.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Although the Amazon Spring Sale doesn&#39;t start in earnest until next week, there are a bunch of early deals to be had. Among them is an offer that sees Google&#39;s Pixel Buds Pro 2 drop to a record low price. The earbuds are currently $179, which is $50 (or 22 percent) off. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are our pick for the best wireless earbuds for Google phones . For one thing, they fit more comfortably and securely after a redesign made them smaller than the Pixel Buds Pro. Improvements to audio quality helped the Pixel Buds Pro 2 obtain a score of 88 in our review . Revisions to the acoustics and drivers — as well as the inclusion of a Tensor chip to take care of active noise cancellation (ANC) and audio signal processing — help the earbuds deliver ample, punchy bass, as well as full mids and crisp highs. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 offer up to eight hours of use on a single charge with ANC enabled. When you factor in the charging case, you&#39;ll get up to 30 hours of total listening time when ANC is on. The earbuds have an IP54 rating, indicating that they&#39;re protected from dust and water splashes. In terms of features, the earbuds include hands-free access to the Gemini voice assistant. Spatial audio is available, albeit only for certain video streaming apps for now. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 offer automatic switching between devices that are linked to your Google account. Other features include conversation detection, a hearing wellness tool and Find My Device.

    "description": "Google’s Nest Learning Thermostat is on sale for $240 right now, as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s close to a record low price for the 4th-gen device that was released just last year . This deal is available for multiple colorways, including silver, gold and black. This is a modern thermostat, so that means AI. The device offers suggestions on how to lower energy usage and can automatically adjust settings in the home based on factors like ambient temperature and daily schedules. It ships with a wireless temperature sensor for accurate measurements. This sensor can run for three years before needing a new battery. This model can accommodate six of these sensors, for large properties, but that requires some additional purchases. A three-pack of the sensors typically costs $100.&nbsp; The Nest Learning Thermostat is more customizable than its predecessors, with the ability to select from several smartwatch-style faces. It’s also much larger than previous models and includes Soli radar sensors to determine how close a person is. The display will adjust accordingly, with an increased font size when standing far away and vice versa. The installation is fairly simple, but will still require some light wiring. The only real bad thing to say about this thermostat is that $280 is a whole lot of money. That concern is mostly alleviated by today’s sale.

The latter includes a six percent discount on Apple&#39;s new 11-inch iPad .&nbsp; The 128GB 2025 model is down to $329 from $349 in every color.

    "description": "Despite streaming services continuing to dominate the business of recorded music, there’s still very much a place for physical media in that sector. The Recording Industry of America said in an annual report [ PDF ] that sales of vinyl records rose for the 18th straight year in the US to $1.4 billion — the highest revenue for that format since 1984, when CDs started to emerge. Vinyl accounted for nearly three-quarters of physical format revenue in 2024. It was the third consecutive year that there were more shipments of vinyl records than CDs — 44 million vs. 33 million. It perhaps helps vinyl’s case that the RIAA has factored in sales figures directly from indie labels for the first time this year. And that Taylor Swift released thirty-six variants of her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department , including eight vinyl editions.&nbsp; Many fans prefer to own physical copies of music for many reasons, such as their belief that vinyl offers better audio quality and an all-round superior listening experience to streaming services, as well as a way to perhaps better support artists . Scouring the racks at a record store is a fun pastime as well. Vinyl records and CDs are also a hedge against the possibility of music vanishing from streaming services if rights agreements expire or an artist decides to yank their music from a platform. Still, streaming services hit a new milestone last year. The RIAA reports that the average number of paid subscriptions for the year hit 100 million in the US for the first time. That’s a three percent increase from 2023. Revenue from paid subscriptions rose by five percent to $11.7 billion, with the total revenue from streaming (factoring everything from ad-supported services to fitness apps) growing four percent to $14.9 billion. Streaming accounted for 84 percent of recorded music revenue for the third year running.

    "description": "You can save on some of our top picks for the best security cameras as part of a sale on Blink gear thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . For instance, the Blink Mini 2 is available for $20 , which is half off the list price. It matches a record low. A two-pack of the Blink Mini 2 is down to $38 as well. That&#39;s not quite a record low, but you&#39;ll still save $22 due to the 46 percent percent discount. We reckon the Blink Mini 2 is the best budget security camera around. You can adjust the webcam-style camera to a variety of angles. It&#39;s weather-resistant, so you can place it outside if you have a special power adapter. The camera picks up decent (but not great) images, particularly those captured in the infrared nighttime view. It also has a built-in LED spotlight. Since Blink is an Amazon company, of course the Mini 2 ties into the Alexa ecosystem. You&#39;ll just need to have a Blink account before you can actually use it. As you might expect, you&#39;ll be able to view images captured by the Mini 2 via the Alexa app on an Echo Show, Fire Tablet or Fire TV but, curiously, not iOS or Android. To see the captures on your phone or tablet, you&#39;ll instead need to use the Blink app. You&#39;ll get some extra features — such as cloud storage and people and pet detection — if you sign up for the Blink Subscription ($3 per month for one camera, $10 per month for any number). Elsewhere in the sale, a five-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras is half off at $200 . This is our recommendation for the best security camera for Alexa users . Having five of them should be enough for many folks to keep an eye on everything that&#39;s going on around their property.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/heres-how-the-pixel-9a-compares-to-the-competition-141043690.html?src=rss",
    "description": "After a mountain of leaks, Google has finally announced the Pixel 9a . There&#39;s a good chance you clicked on this article to find out how the 9a compares to its predecessor . The good news is you came to the right place. Even better, it&#39;s a favorable comparison.&nbsp; Pixel 9a vs Pixel 8a&nbsp; For starters, the Pixel 9a features a new design. Instead of borrowing the design language of Google&#39;s more expensive devices, the new phone has its own identity. Gone is the divisive camera bar that has defined recent Pixel phones. Instead, the main camera module is nearly flush with the rear of the phone. Additionally, the new handset offers slightly better ingress protection. It&#39;s IP68-certified against water and dust, up from IP67 on the 8a. The Pixel 9a will also be available two lovely new colors: Iris and Peony. Sadly, Google won&#39;t offer an Aloe colorway this time around, at least not at release.&nbsp; Outside of those changes, the 9a sports a larger 6.3 display. Like with the 8a, Google has gone with a FHD panel, meaning the 9a&#39;s screen is slightly less dense due to it being a bit larger overall. However, it&#39;s the better display. The 9a&#39;s pOLED panel is capable of reaching a peak brightness of 2,700 nits, up from 2,000 nits on the 8a. It&#39;s also HDR10+ certified, with a 120Hz refresh rate. That additional brightness will make it easier to see the 9a&#39;s screen in bright sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internally, the 9a features Google&#39;s latest Tensor G4 SoC, paired once again with 8GB of RAM. Google has also outfitted the 9a with a larger 5,100mAh battery, up from 4,492mAh on the 8a. Just as importantly, the 9a is capable of charging at a faster 23W. That&#39;s still slow compared to a device like the Nothing 3a Pro, which is compatible with 50W power adapters, but an improvement over the 8a&#39;s glacial 18W. Oh, and if you were hoping for Qi2 support , I&#39;m sorry to say the 9a is limited to charging at 7.5W wirelessly.&nbsp; As for cameras, Google hasn&#39;t changed its winning formula. The 9a features a 48MP main camera with f/1.7 lens and optical image stabilization (OIS). On paper, that might seem like a downgrade from the 8a&#39;s 64MP main sensor, but they both feature a 0.8µm pixel pitch, meaning they&#39;re capable of capturing the same amount of light, and it appears Google sourced a newer sensor for the 9a. Otherwise, the Pixel 9a appears to feature the same ultrawide and selfie cameras as its predecessor. As always, when you buy a Pixel phone, you&#39;re buying it for Google&#39;s computational photography features, and you get all the usual standouts like Night Sight, Best Take and more.&nbsp; Pixel 9a vs iPhone 16e and Nothing 3a Pro The iPhone 16e continues to confound since its announcement in February. At $599, it&#39;s a full $100 more expensive than the Pixel 9a, and comparing the two based on hardware alone, Google&#39;s new midrange phone is the better deal. You get a significantly bigger battery, a 120Hz display and an entire extra camera. Of course, whether you should buy the 9a over the 16e will entirely depend on your preference for Android over iOS. If you like prefer Apple&#39;s software, the Pixel 9a won&#39;t do it for you.&nbsp; The more interesting comparison is between the 9a and Nothing&#39;s new Phone 3a Pro . For $40 less, you get an even bigger screen, a more original design and, most notably, a periscope camera that offers 3x optical zoom. A great telephoto is really hard to find at this price range, so the 3a Pro might be worth considering for that reason alone. The tradeoff is Google&#39;s software support is unmatched, and 3a Pro comes with a limited warranty in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pixel 9a Pixel 8a iPhone 16e Nothing 3a Pro Price $499/$559 $499/$559 $599 / $699 / $899 $459 Dimensions 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9 mm (6.09 x 2.89 x 0.35 inches) 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9 mm (6 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches) 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8 mm (5.78 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches) 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.9 mm (6.44 x 3.05 x 0.33 inches) Weight 186g (6.56 ounces) 188g (6.7 ounces) 167g (5.88 ounces) 211g (7.44 ounces) Screen size 6.3 inches 6.1 inches 6.1 inches 6.77 inches Screen resolution 1080 x 2,424 pixels (421ppi) 1,080 x 2,400 pixels (430ppi) 1,170 x 2,532 pixels (460 ppi) 1,080 x 2,392 pixels (387ppi) Screen type pOLED pOLED OLED AMOLED SoC Tensor G4 Tensor G3 Apple A18 Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 RAM 8GB 8GB 8GB 12GB Battery 5,100mAh 4,492mAh 4,005mAh 5,000mAh Storage 128 / 256 GB 128 / 256 GB 128 / 256 / 512 GB 256 GB Rear cameras Wide: 48MP, f/1.7 Ultrawide: 13MP, f/2.2 Wide: 64MP, f/1.89 Ultrawide: 13MP, f/2.2 Wide: 48MP, f/1.6 Wide: 50MP, f1/1.9 Ultrawide: 8MP, f/2.2 Periscope telephoto: 50MP, f/2.6 Front camera 13MP, f/2.2 13MP, f/2.2 12MP, f/1.9 50MP, f/2.2 Water / dust rating IP68 IP67 IP68 IP64 Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth v6.0 v5.3 v5.3 v5.4 OS Android 15 Android 15 iOS 18 Android 15 / Nothing OS 3.1 Colors Obsidian / Porcelain / Iris / Peony Obsidian / Porcelain / Aloe / Bay Black / White Black / Gray This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/heres-how-the-pixel-9a-compares-to-the-competition-141043690.html?src=rss",

    "description": "If you can&#39;t open a window for whatever reason, an air purifier can help make the air in your home a bit more comfortable. One of our favorites, the Levoit Core 400S air purifier , is on sale for $187 thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . While that&#39;s not a record low — we&#39;ve seen it as low as $177 last year — it&#39;s still a good discount on one of the most convenient air purifiers for large spaces. We’ve featured Levoit in our list of the best air purifiers for its strong performance and smart features. The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to. One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands. Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness. If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.

    "description": "Gone are the days of kids asking their parent to borrow cash or their card when going out with friends. Instead, parents can now give their kids access to Google Wallet for making in-store payments with their Android device. Google first announced that this feature was coming back in October.&nbsp; Kids can also use Google Wallet to store passes to things, including a library card, ticket for an event or a gift card. But, parents have a lot of oversight, such as receiving an email every time their child makes a purchase. They can also monitor everything within Family Link, along with remove a payment card or shut off access to all passes.&nbsp; Google Right now, Google is just rolling out the new feature for families in the US, UK, Australia, Spain and Poland. Parents in any of these locations should see the option pop up within the next few weeks.&nbsp; Apple users can already access a similar feature with Apple Cash Family . Parents can set up anyone in their Family Sharing group and let them make purchases, or send and receive money through their wallet or messages. Just like on Android, parents can see their kids&#39; purchases and get notifications each time they buy something.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-google-pixel-9a-might-be-the-new-midrange-smartphone-king-140021156.html?src=rss",
    "description": "A couple of weeks ago, Apple released a more affordable take on its flagship handsets with the iPhone 16e. But now Google is hitting back with the Pixel 9a and from what I&#39;ve seen, it looks like a way better deal. From the front, the 9a looks a lot like the standard Pixel 9 . Its screen is the same size at 6.3 inches across, while also offering a 120Hz refresh rate and a surprisingly strong 2,700 nits of peak brightness. On the inside, the 9a packs a Tensor G4 chip, just like you get on its more expensive siblings, along with other handy features including an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and Google’s standard seven years of OS updates, feature drops and security patches. But Google did something a bit surprising by giving the 9a a 5,100mAh battery, which is technically the biggest power pack in any member of the Pixel 9 family. That includes the Pixel 9 Pro XL (5,060mAh), though only by just a tiny bit. Regardless, Google says this gives the 9a the best longevity of any Pixel on sale today. If you flip the phone around, there are some other changes such as a new iris purple hue, which joins the existing peony, porcelain and obsidian color options. But the thing that jumps out the most is the lack of a camera bar, which has been present on practically all of Google’s phones dating back to the Pixel 6 . Instead, you get a simple window that sits almost flush against the back of the device — a window which Google says was inspired by the shape of a water drop. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Unfortunately, you don’t get a dedicated optical zoom (though it does support up to 8x digital SuperRes zoom). There is a 48MP main sensor that is similar, but slightly different to the one used on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and a 13MP sensor for its ultra-wide cam. The 9a also includes a built-in AI macro focus feature so you can get really close to things, on top of support for tons of Pixel-specific camera tools like Add Me, Best Take, Magic Editor and more. Notably, because it&#39;s powered by the Tensor G4, the 9a has access to all of the same AI features available on the rest of the Pixel 9 line. This includes Gemini Live Video, the Pixel Recorder app, and Pixel Studio not to mention security and safety offerings like Google VPN, car crash detection and so on. Sadly, I only had a brief time with the phone so we weren&#39;t able to test out many of its new features. Google seems to be feeling pretty confident about this phone, with the company saying that it will have the best cameras on any handset under $500. That&#39;s a pretty big claim, but it’s not entirely outlandish as Google&#39;s camera processing has been top-notch for quite some time. And with a starting price of $499, the Pixel 9a is skating in right under that line. So what&#39;s the catch — all this for $300 less than a regular Pixel 9? From what I&#39;ve seen so far, the biggest differences between the standard Pixel 9 and the 9a are that Google hasn&#39;t improved the latter&#39;s 23-watt wired or 7.5-watt wireless charging speeds, both of which are rather slow compared to a full-priced flagship. You also get less RAM, with the 9a featuring 8GB instead of 12GB. And while the 9a has Gorilla Glass covering its screen in front, around back there&#39;s a plastic panel made from around 85 percent recycled materials. But again, for three Benjamins less than the standard model, those are compromises I&#39;m mostly willing to put up with. The Google Pixel 9a will be available sometime in April starting at $499 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (the 256GB model is an optional upgrade). Purchases include free three-month subscriptions for Google One and YouTube Premium along with a six-month trial for Fitbit Premium.

    "description": "As was the case last year, Amazon will have another big sale to usher in spring for 2025. The Amazon Spring Sale is officially on the books, taking place from March 25 through March 31. The online retail giant is billing this as a good way for folks to stock up on end-of-season winter items, and save on all things fashion, beauty and household and outdoor gear. If last year was any indication, the Amazon Spring Sale won&#39;t be as much of a boon for tech deals as, say, Prime Day in July. However, there are always a number of decent deals that pop up on wireless earbuds, tablets and more. Considering the spring nature of the sale, we expect to see discounts on robot and cordless vacuums, household tech like air purifiers and even some smart home gear. With that in mind, here are the best early Amazon Spring Sale deals you can shop right now. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals so far Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you prefer desktops, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Apple AirTags (four-pack) for $70 ($29 off): These are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra wideband features for locating your things when they’re close by. Just attach them to your keys, wallet or bag with the right AirTag holder and keep track of everything in the Find My app. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Apple Watch Series 10 for $329 ($70 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $199 ($50 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $798 ($152 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $159 (42 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "description": "There’s now an industry-wide union for video game workers in the US and Canada. The United Videogame Workers-CWA (UVW-CWA) has a mission to bring together &quot;artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, freelancers and beyond to build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status.&quot; The union makes its official debut at the &quot;Video Game Labor at a Crossroads: New Pathways to Industry-Wide Organizing&quot; panel at GDC. Workers will be sharing a petition at the event to gain support for the union and to shine a light on the recent glut of industry layoffs . As a matter of fact, the first major issue the union seeks to address is layoffs, given that one in ten developers were shown the door in 2024. UVW-CWA Workers will also be passing around a zine that includes the organization’s mission statement, FAQs and an op-ed. This is a direct-join union, meaning that workers can sign up on their own. This allows folks to bypass traditional unionization processes like elections and employer consent. We aren’t sure if this will catch on throughout the industry or if major publishers will recognize the union. However, it’s just the latest salvo in the ongoing battle between industry workers and corporate bigwigs. Over 600 QA workers at Activision, which is owned by Microsoft, recently joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA.) ZeniMax Online Studios workers formed their own union at the tail-end of last year and Sega of America workers did something similar . These unions have also been busy. The CWA has been embroiled in a fight with Microsoft and Activision over unfair labor practices on behalf of workers at Raven Software. Members of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA also went on a one-day strike last year to limit Microsoft’s use of outsourcing.

    "description": "If you’ve been eyeing a pair of Beats Fit Pro earbuds, now’s a great time to snag them at a discount. The fitness-focused wireless earbuds have dropped to $169 ahead of the Amazon Spring Sale , down from their usual $200 price tag, which is the lowest price we’ve seen them since January. This $30 discount makes them an even better buy for those looking for good sound quality with a snug and secure fit. The Beats Fit Pro earned the top spot as the best wireless earbuds for working out in our best wireless earbuds roundup thanks to their IPX4 water resistance rating, comfortable design and balanced audio. They feature active noise cancellation (ANC), spatial audio with dynamic head tracking and Apple’s H1 chip for seamless pairing with iOS devices. While they’re most convenient for Apple users, they also work well with Android devices thanks to Google Fast Pair support. They’re available at the discounted price in black, white, sage gray and stone purple, so this Big Spring Sale deal isn’t limited to just one color. Designed with fitness enthusiasts in mind, the Fit Pro earbuds include flexible wingtips that help keep them securely in place, whether you’re out for a run or powering through an intense gym session. Battery life is also solid, offering six hours of listening time per charge with an additional 18 hours from the charging case. If you need a quick boost, a Fast Fuel charge delivers up to one hour of playback in just five minutes. If you&#39;re looking for something more affordable, the Beats Studio Buds+ have also received a major price drop. They’re currently on sale for $130 on Amazon, a decent markdown from their usual $170 price. These earbuds offer solid ANC, an improved transparency mode and a comfortable, lightweight design. We were impressed with them and gave them a respectable 84 out of 100 in our Beats Studio Buds+ review . Whether you’re after a workout companion like the Fit Pro or an everyday pair like the Studio Buds+, both deals make for great savings on quality wireless earbuds.

    "description": "While Tesla is a popular car for ride-hailing drivers employed by the likes of Uber and more, the company could soon cut out the middleman. The California Public Utilities Commission has approved the company&#39;s bid for a transportation charter-party carrier permit, Bloomberg reports . The permit opens the way for Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber, Lyft and other established companies. Tesla employees would drive the cars, initially transporting fellow employees, before becoming available to the public. Last year, Elon Musk told investors that the company was already testing app-based transportation for Bay Area employees using safety drivers. Notably, Tesla is still not approved to use autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing, though Musk has claimed they will be available in Austin, Texas by June and in California by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Uber and Waymo launched their robotaxi service in Austin earlier this month. Waymo&#39;s autonomous ride-hailing service is also available in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.&nbsp;&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/tesla-gets-approval-for-ride-hailing-business-in-california-125100455.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Carl Erik Rinsch, the director of 47 Ronin , has been charged for defrauding a streaming service out of $11 million, according to the Southern District of New York&#39;s US Attorney&#39;s Office . While the court documents didn&#39;t name the service, an old report from The New York Times made it obvious that it was none other than Netflix . In 2018, Rinsch pitched a sci-fi series called White Horse , referencing the first horseman of the apocalypse, to several services, namely Amazon, Apple, HBO, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube. The Times&#39; report said that Amazon had already won the bidding war, but Netflix&#39;s former VP of Original Content, Cindy Holland, called Rinsch on a weekend and offered millions more, along with the privilege of making a director&#39;s cut.&nbsp; In its announcement of the indictment, the US Attorney&#39;s Office explained that Netflix had paid $44 million for the development of White Horse, which had been renamed to Conquest , between 2018 and 2019. Some of that money went to paying off the project&#39;s earliest investors. (Keanu Reeves, the star of 47 Ronin , sank his own money into the project after Rinsch got in trouble with 30West, one of the project&#39;s first investors, for not reaching a deadline.) Between late 2019 and early 2020, Rinsch asked Netflix for more funding, and the company gave him $11 million more to complete the series. But Rinsch never finished the show, and Netflix accused him of using those funds to make &quot;personal and speculative purchases of securities.&quot; The director allegedly lost most of the $11 million to trading, but he made it back and earned more from investing the rest on cryptocurrency. Rinsch allegedly went on a shopping spree after that, spending almost $4 million on furniture and antiques, $2.4 million on five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, as well as $652,000 on luxury watches and clothing. The indictment also said that Rinsch spent over $1 million to sue Netflix for more money. According to The Times&#39; report, Rinsch claimed in his lawsuit that Netflix broke its contract and owed him several more payments worth $14 million. In the midst of all of these, Rinsch reportedly displayed erratic behavior: He allegedly claimed to have discovered Covid-19’s secret transmission mechanism, treated the show&#39;s staff horribly and accused his wife of plotting his assassination. Conquest was supposed to be about a genius who invented a human-like species called Organic Intelligent. These OIs are deployed to solve problems and provide humanitarian aid around the world, but they are, of course, not what they seem and are hiding a darker nature. Rinsch has been charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, both of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He was also charged with five counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, each count carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years.

    "description": "Playdate , the little yellow gaming machine with a crank, is getting a price increase in a few days. In a newsletter that Panic has sent out, the developer said that Playdates will cost $229 starting on March 25 but that you can still get the device for $199 until then. Apparently, Panic moved to a new factory, and it would &quot;cost quite a bit more&quot; to manufacture the devices there than at the company&#39;s old facility. Panic cited manufacturing costs, as well, when it raised the handheld&#39;s price from $179 to $199 last year.&nbsp; On the day the Playdate is getting a price hike, Panic is also dropping &quot;an (extremely) limited stock&quot; of systems that are either fully refurbished at its factory or have &quot;very minor cosmetic issues.&quot; The refurbished units will sell for $179, and Panic says that they &quot;work great,&quot; can &quot;play games perfectly&quot; and come with a six-month warranty. &quot;If price has kept you from buying a Playdate, we&#39;re hopeful these great systems might help,&quot; the company has written in its announcement.&nbsp; The handheld gaming console came out in 2022. It has a black-and-white screen with over 150 games that you can download from its Catalog. While the device has the traditional arrow and gaming buttons, it also has a crank that developers incorporate into their games — in Chopter Copter , for instance, you&#39;ll have to turn the Playdate on its side to use the crank as a helicopter-style rotor. If you already have a Playdate, the company is having a Catalog Anniversary Sale right now until March 20, where you can stock up on more titles for the handheld. Panic also reconfirmed that it&#39;s working with developers to put together a Season 2 bundle , which will deliver a set number of games in a curated collection to buyers&#39; devices over a certain period.

Whether you’re looking to shed a few pounds, track your muscle gains or stay on top of your wellness routine, a smart scale can be the perfect sidekick. These scales don’t just show you your weight; they provide insights into body composition, muscle mass and even your metabolic rate, all the while synching with your favorite health apps. Smart scales make staying on track easier than ever before, with many able to store multiple user profiles to track everyone in your household’s fitness journey. Plus, they’re designed for accuracy, giving you more confidence in your overall progress if, in those early days, you can’t see the benefits in the mirror. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a data geek or just want to feel healthier, there’s a smart scale out there to suit your needs. Table of contents Smart scale safety Best smart scales for 2025 What to look for in a smart scale How we tested and which smart scales we tested Smart scales FAQs Smart scale safety There are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat. Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.” A meta-analysis from 2016 found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A 2018 study , however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight. Best smart scales for 2025 What to look for in a smart scale Weight A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal. Connectivity Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised. Bone density The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass. Body fat percentage and muscle mass Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition monitor can measure your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. BMI A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both overly simplistic and often greatly misleading . Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care. Pulse Wave Velocity French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights. Wearables and integration Pairing your smart scale with wearables like fitness trackers or smartwatches can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place. Display Less a specification and more a note: Smart scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display. App and subscriptions You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware. Data portability Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere. All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.) Power It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails. How we tested and which smart scales we tested For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers: Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2 Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four. Fitbit Aira Air Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway. Anker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health. It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat. Omron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product. A solid, reliable, sturdy, strong (checks the dictionary for more synonyms) dependable piece of kit. There’s no romance or excitement on show, but you can trust that however joyless it may be, it’ll do the job in question and will be user-friendly. The hardware is limited, the app is limited, but it certainly (checks synonyms again) is steady. Joking aside, Omron’s Connect app is as bare-bones as you can get, since it acts as an interface for so many of its products. Scroll over to the Weight page, and you’ll get your weight and BMI reading, and if you’ve set a fitness goal, you can see how far you’ve got to go to reach it. You can also switch to seeing a trend graph which, again, offers the most basic visualization of your workouts and progress. Garmin Index S2 Garmin’s got a pretty massive fitness ecosystem of its own, so if you’re already part of that world, its smart scale is a no-brainer. On one hand, the scale is one of the easiest to use, and most luxurious of the bunch, with its color screen and sleek design. I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail. If there’s a downside, it’s that Garmin’s setup won’t hold your hand, since it’s for serious fitness people, not newbies. Withings Body Comp At the highest end, Withings’ flagship Body Comp is luxurious, and luxuriously priced, a figure I’d consider to be “too much” to spend on a bathroom scale. For your money, however, you’ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of body composition metrics including your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin’s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware’s overall sleek look. Withings Body Scan If you want to flaunt your cash, you don’t buy a car, you buy a super car, or a hyper car if you’re flush enough. What then, do we call Withings’ $400 Body Scan if not a super -smart scale, or a hyper -smart scale? As well as doing everything the Body Comp does, plus running a six-lead ECG, segmented body composition, and will even check for neuropathy in your feet. It is the best scale I’ve ever used, it is also the most expensive, and I suspect it’s too much device for almost everyone who’d consider buying one. Smart scales FAQs What&#39;s the difference between a smart scale and a regular scale? A regular scale is pretty straightforward — it tells you how much you weigh, and that’s usually it. A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model. What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing. How do smart scales work with more than one person using it? When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it. Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve upgraded your phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports wireless charging. Battery life can be one of the first things to deteriorate as your phone ages, so you’ll need quick and easy ways to power up wherever you are. You may not always be able to have a cable on your person, but investing in a wireless phone charger (or a few) can make it more convenient to plop your phone down and know it’ll have more juice when you pick it back up again. While you’re not going to get the same charging speed with a wireless charger that you would with a power cable, the convenience of a power source like this is undeniable. Stick a wireless charger on your bedside, on your desk at work, in your kitchen or wherever you spend a good chunk of your time and you’ll have a reliable way to power up your phone, sans bulky, messy cables. Needless to say, there are a ton of options out there with different charging capabilities and price ranges. Below, we’ve collected the best wireless chargers we’ve tested to make your search a little easier. Table of contents Best wireless chargers for 2025 What to look for in a wireless charger Where and how will you use your charger? Wireless charging performance Quality and box contents Wireless chargers FAQs Best wireless chargers for 2025 What to look for in a wireless charger While it’s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a multi-device wireless charger . Where and how will you use your charger? Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours. For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For travelling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Wireless charging performance Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones. There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple’s latest MagSafe charging pad can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter — the latter being another component you’ll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can. Quality and box contents Pay attention to what’s included in the box. Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link. Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs. You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station. Wireless chargers FAQs Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case? Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported. How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging? Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.” Do cords charge your phone faster? Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.

    "description": "President Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to remake the US government continued today with the firing of the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission. This agency has historically had five members: three from the same party as the president and two from the opposing party. The New York Times reported that the president terminated the roles for FTC Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya.&nbsp; Both Slaughter and Bedoya said today that firing them is illegal. Commissioners&#39; terms can only be ended early for good cause , such as &quot;inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.&quot; Also, no more than three commissioners can come from the same political party, meaning the pair also cannot be replaced by additional Republicans. It seems likely that Trump will face a legal challenge over the attempt to eliminate these positions. &quot;The law protects the independence of the Commission because the law serves the American people, not corporate power,&quot; Slaughter said in a statement. &quot;The reason that the FTC can be so effective for the American people is because of its independence and because its commissioners serve across political parties and ideologies. Removing opposition voices may not change what the Trump majority can do, but it does change whether they will have accountability when they do it.&quot; Bedoya also posted about the action on X, seconding Slaughter&#39;s statement that removing their posts is illegal. &quot;Tomorrow I will testify before the Colorado Joint House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and will have more to say then,&quot; he wrote. Trump signed an executive order in February attempting to exert more control over several agencies that were formed to intentionally remain outside the White House&#39;s purview. The order targeted agencies such as the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FTC recently deleted all the posts on its business blog from President Biden&#39;s administration, leaving a four-year gap with no published compliance advice.

    "description": "The Federal Trade Commission has removed all posts from President Joe Biden&#39;s term in office from its business blog. This online publication has historically provided advice about how companies could best comply with consumer-protection regulations, covering topics such as artificial intelligence and how big tech companies have collected and used customer data. Currently, it has no content published between December 21, 2020 and March 7, 2025. Wired highlighted some of the notable content from the more than 300 blog posts that have been deleted. Several current and former FTC officials spoke to the publication about the change anonymously out of fear of retaliation. “In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” one source said. The FTC is being led by President Donald Trump&#39;s nominee, Andrew Ferguson. At the time of his appointment, Ferguson said he would use the department to &quot;end Big Tech&#39;s vendetta against competition and free speech.&quot; He and other Republicans have claimed that many platforms are censoring right-wing content, adding a heavy layer of irony to the FTC&#39;s latest actions. &quot;They are talking a big game on censorship,&quot; another source told Wired . &quot;But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies&#39; bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-ftc-has-removed-all-business-blog-posts-from-the-biden-administration-214734633.html?src=rss",

All that&#39;s different here is a single stream that runs through each of them in order around the clock. If episodes average 22 minutes long, that would have the stream taking nearly 12 days to refresh.

Just like the original, the headphones ship with a USB dongle for 2.4GHz. However, it can connect without a dongle when using certain newer HP Omen gaming laptops . HyperX A long-lasting battery isn’t the only innovation the Cloud III S brings to the table. It’s also fully customizable, via magnetic ear plates. These are 3D-printed on demand, which is something HyperX has been experimenting with for a while . Users can create and buy these customized 3D-printed ear plates directly from HyperX, but only in select countries. There’s also a removable boom mic for traveling, but that won’t impede the ability to take calls or trash talk other gamers. The headphones feature a backup omni-directional mic, which is a nice touch. The HyperX Cloud III S is expected to hit store shelves in May, but pricing hasn’t been solidified yet. For reference, the original Cloud III launched for $170. The new headset will be available in an all-back or black and red.

    "description": "Sarah Wynn-Williams joined Facebook in 2011 when it was very much in its “move fast and break things” era. A former United Nations diplomat, she had aspirations of helping Facebook boost its standing on the global stage. Over nearly seven years at the company, she had a front-row seat to some of Facebook’s most consequential (and controversial) moments. Last week, she published Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism , a memoir about her time at the company and how she slowly became disillusioned about Facebook’s role in the world. Since it was announced, Meta has thrown the full weight of its PR machine against the book. The company initiated arbitration proceedings, which resulted in a ruling that now prevents Wynn-Williams from promoting her own book. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the arbitrator’s decision “affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published.” He said that “urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry’s standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years.” Her publisher, Flatiron Books, said in a statement it was “appalled” by Meta’s actions, noting that “the arbitrator&#39;s order makes no reference to the claims” in the book, which “went through a thorough editing and vetting process.” After reading the book, it’s easy to see why Meta PR has made such a fuss. Wynn-Williams worked closely with the company’s top executives, traveling around the world with Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg as they met with foreign leaders and shaped the policies that would define Facebook. She also delivers many firsthand accounts of what Zuckerberg, Sandberg and current Chief of Global Affairs Joel Kaplan did and said behind closed doors. Much of it isn’t pretty. Here are some of her most shocking claims: Zuckerberg requested to be “gently mobbed” during a visit to Asia Wynn-Williams was often tasked with organizing the meetings various Facebook executives took with heads of state and other government officials. One of the more bizarre details is Zuckerberg’s request ahead of a three-week long trip to Asia. According to Wynn-Williams, Zuckerberg requested that she arrange either a “peace rally” or a “riot” during his visit. Facebook’s CEO never explains the request, but Wynn-Williams speculates he wanted &quot;to test out how effective his product is in turning Facebook’s online tools into offline power.” At first, I think he&#39;s joking. Peace rallies are not my area of expertise, and-to be frank-I&#39;ve never been asked to organize a riot before. Especially one for a tech CEO. I assume something has been lost in his communication-that it&#39;s some sort of mix-up. &quot;Riot&quot; and &quot;peace rally&quot; are such completely different things. Then Debbie emails to say that she ran into Mark and he told her that he wants a peace rally or a riot and we need to come up with some ideas that will enable him to be surrounded by people or be &quot;gently mobbed.&quot; Zuckerberg refused to take meetings before noon, even with heads of state Zuckerberg apparently had a “strict” policy about not taking any meetings before noon. This policy applied not only to internal meetings with others at Facebook, but heads of state. Wynn-Williams recounts how Zuckerberg’s “refusal” to take morning meetings almost derailed a planned meeting with the president of Colombia. That same year, she said she was forced to reschedule Zuckerberg’s address at the UN to a later time slot because, according to Wynn-Williams, “the United Nations isn’t important enough for Mark to do an event before noon.” Meta built Zuckerberg a special room to protect him from Zika Facebook took “extreme measures” to protect Zuckerberg from Zika during a visit to Peru for the APEC conference. To protect the CEO, who was apparently hoping to soon conceive his second child, the company opted &quot;to build a ‘controlled structure’ on the site of the APEC conference center where ventilation, exposure to others, and bug mitigation can be overseen by Facebook.” Wynn-Williams dubbed it “operation perfect sperm.” Zuckerberg’s “desperate” attempts to talk to Xi Jinping Wynn-Williams spends a lot of time delving into Facebook’s plans to bring the social network to China . She also details Zuckerberg’s attempts to get face time with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In 2015, Zuckerberg flew to Seattle for a “longer than normal” handshake with Xi (who was in the city for a tech summit Zuckerberg was not invited to). He later caused a “diplomatic crisis” when he posted a photo of that handshake, which only shows the back of Xi’s head. The following year, Zuckerberg and his team hoped to surreptitiously get the CEO in front of Xi at APEC in Peru. Facebook arranged for Zuckerberg to give a speech directly before an appearance by Xi, which meant the two men would be in adjacent dressing rooms. The goal, according to Wynn-Williams, was to engineer a “spontaneous encounter” during which Zuckerberg could make his pitch to get Facebook into China. But when Xi arrived, he was flanked by “dozens and dozens” of men in military uniforms who created a barrier such that, according to Wynn-Williams, Xi didn&#39;t even have to “risk making eye contact with Mark.” She says that Zuckerberg was “hurt” by the demonstration. Sheryl Sandberg wanted Facebook to promote organ donation Not long after starting at Facebook, Wynn-Williams says she was told that “Facebook’s first proactive initiative to build relationships with governments around the world will be organ donation.” The idea was apparently Sandberg’s, who ran into a former Harvard friend and transplant surgeon and “offered to help him source donors.” But when Wynn-Williams brought up the logistical and legal issues that generally make it difficult to transport organs between countries, she says Sandberg was “indignant.” “Do you mean to tell me that if my four-year-old was dying and the only thing that would save her was a new kidney, that I couldn’t fly to Mexico and get one and put it in my handbag?” Facebook would later add organ donation to the “life events” users could add to their profiles. Sheryl Sandberg and the plane crash that wasn&#39;t In 2013, an Asiana flight from Seoul to San Francisco crash-landed on a runway, killing two people and injuring more than 100 passengers. Sandberg, who was promoting her book Lean In at the time, was also traveling from Seoul to San Francisco that day. Following the crash, she posted on Facebook that she and several Facebook colleagues were originally meant to be on that flight but had “switched to United so we could use miles for my family&#39;s tickets.” Sandberg’s supposed near-miss generated multiple headlines, which isn’t surprising, as Wynn-Williams claims Sandberg was personally briefing reporters about the incident. Wynn-Williams was baffled by these reports. She writes that the Facebook COO “always flies United” and “never considered Asiana.” In her recollection, she and another colleague remarked to each other how “weird” it was for Sandberg to do this. Why Zuckerberg and Sandberg’s Facebook posts get so much engagement Wynn-Williams heavily implies that there may be some behind-the-scenes manipulation of Zuckerberg and Sandberg’s Facebook posts. She doesn’t offer any proof that this has happened, but says that a meeting attended by “someone from Mark’s personal communications team” raises the possibility. According to Wynn-Williams, “Sheryl’s assistant describes his job as managing ‘engagement for Mark and Sheryl&#39;s social media using all of Facebook&#39;s tools.’” When Wynn-Williams asks directly if they are “gaming” the site’s algorithm, she says the assistant replies that “you don’t want to know.” Joel Kaplan needed a geography lesson Some of the most telling anecdotes in Careless People involve Kaplan, who joined Facebook’s policy team in 2011 and was promoted to Chief Global Affairs Officer earlier this year. She writes that Kaplan, who was a deputy chief of staff in the George W. Bush White House, was “surprised to learn Taiwan is an island” and that “often when we start to talk about pressing issues in some country in Latin America or Asia, he stops and asks me to explain where the country is.” Kaplan slow-rolled Facebook’s response to problems in Myanmar By now, Meta’s failures in Myanmar, where hate speech and misinformation on Facebook helped incite a genocide , are well documented. Wynn-Williams, who early in her tenure flew to Myanmar to try to sell officials there on the company’s connectivity projects, describes her futile attempts to get more resources for content moderation in the country. She blames Kaplan in particular. She says she “started this long process of trying to hire someone for Myanmar in 2015” and found a human rights expert who fit the bill in May 2016, but Kaplan blocked her from making the hire in February of 2017. He allegedly told her to “move on and get over it.” She later concludes that “when it came to Myanmar, those people just didn’t matter to him.” (Meta had broadly labeled Wynn-Williams’ claims about Facebook’s actions in Myanmar as “old news,” saying in a statement that “the facts here have been public record since 2018, and we have said publicly we know we were too slow to act on abuse on our services in Myanmar.”) Kaplan’s alleged harassment Wynn-Williams also accuses Kaplan of harassment and other inappropriate behavior. After complications while giving birth left her in a literal coma, she writes that Kaplan asked her over one of their “regular” calls during her maternity leave “where are you bleeding from” and got angry when she didn&#39;t answer. Later, when she returned to work, he gave her an unofficial performance review on her first day back, saying that she wasn’t “responsive enough.” Wynn-Williams eventually reports Kaplan’s behavior and an investigation is opened, but that “very quickly it seems to switch from an investigation of Joel, or the facts, to an investigation of me.” She’s fired at her next performance review. Meta has disputed Wynn-Williams&#39; allegations. “ This book is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,&quot; a spokesperson said in a statement. &quot;Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.&quot; Update, March 18, 2025, 1:57 PM PT: Wynn-Williams describes her tenure at Facebook as lasting seven years, beginning in 2011. But, according to a Meta spokesperson, she was fired in &quot;late 2017.&quot; This story has been updated to reflect that she worked at Facebook for &quot;nearly&quot; seven years.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-stream-every-march-madness-2025-game-181552865.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The brackets are set and the teams are en route to their respective arenas. The 2025 NCAA Tournaments, affectionately known to many as March Madness , begin this week. The men’s tournament begins first on March 18 with the women’s version tipping off on March 19. Both will begin with First Four or “play-in” games (depending on who you ask) before providing action on the court through the first weekend in April. Different broadcasters own the rights to each tournament, so streaming them both can be confusing. I’ve broken down the best, most affordable way to access each one so that you&#39;ll be ready when the games begin. When does March Madness start? The men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament begins on Tuesday, March 18 with two of the so-called First Four matchups. These are the four games that are used to determine the final four teams in the main 64-team bracket. To some, they’re known as the “play-in games” although they’ve officially been part of the men&#39;s tournament since 2011. The first game on March 18 begins at 6:40PM ET with another to follow at 9:10PM ET. The same schedule is expected for the second slate of games on Wednesday, March 19. On the women’s side, March Madness is offset from the men’s tournament by a day. The first two of the First Four games are Wednesday, March 19 at 7PM ET and 9PM ET. The second pair of matchups follows on Thursday, March 20 in the same two time slots. The 64-team bracket kicks off in earnest for the men at 12:15PM ET on Thursday, March 20. For the women, the main action begins at 11:30AM ET on Friday, March 21st. Here’s the full schedule for each tournament: 2025 Men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament First Four: March 18-19 First round: March 20-21 Second round: March 22-23 Sweet 16: March 27-28 Elite Eight: March 29-30 Final Four: April 5 Championship game: April 7 2025 Women’s NCAA Basketball Tournament First Four: March 19-20 First round: March 21-22 Second round: March 23-24 Sweet 16: March 28-29 Elite Eight: March 30-31 Final Four: April 4 Championship game: April 6 How to stream the 2025 Men’s NCAA Tournament ASSOCIATED PRESS CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery share the broadcast rights to the men’s tournament, and as they have in years past, TV coverage will be spread across four networks. During the course of March Madness, games will air on CBS, TNT, TBS and truTV, with the final rounds and championship game landing on CBS. If you already have a paid TV plan (such as traditional cable), the best way to watch the men’s tournament is with the March Madness Live app or website. Once you log in with your TV provider credentials, you can watch every game in one spot with features like multiview (up to four games at once) and “excitement alerts” that let you know when there’s a close game. The app also offers ways to follow your bracket, if you filled it out on MarchMadness.com. And when you’re watching on desktop, the crucial Boss Button will throw up a fake work screen when you need it. March Madness Live is also available on Amazon, Fire TV, Apple TV, iOS, macOS, Google Play, LG smart TVs, Roku and Xbox devices. If you don’t have a compatible TV provider already, your best option is to actually use two services. It’s not ideal, I know, but it will save you a lot of money. Max’s Standard plan is $17/month and gives you access to live games from TNT, TBS and truTV. While you can watch NCAA Tournament games with the Basic with Ads tier, B/R Sports, which powers all of the live coverage on Max, will only be available on Standard and Premium levels starting March 30. Yes, Warner Bros. Discovery set its policy to change in the middle of the tournament to make more money. For the CBS games, you’ll need a Paramount+ with Showtime subscription that costs $13/month. So, in total, your best option to stream all of the men’s tournament is $30 spread across two apps.&nbsp; A live TV service like YouTube TV or Hulu plus Live TV is over $50 more per month at full price, but they would offer you “one-stop shopping” for all the games in the men’s tournament. YouTube TV is currently on sale for $70/month for the first six months you use it.&nbsp; How to stream the 2025 Women’s NCAA Tournament ASSOCIATED PRESS While Warner Brothers Discovery owns the rights to the men’s NCAA Tournament, ESPN has the women’s bracket locked down. Every game of the women’s tournament will be spread across ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNEWS, including the First Four matchups. The Final Four will be on ESPN, but the championship game will air on ABC. All three of those culminating games will stream on ESPN+. Since ESPN+ won’t get every game, it’s not an option if you want to watch the entire tournament. You will be able to watch “select matchups” on both ESPN+ and Disney+, but ESPN hasn’t announced what those will be. So, unfortunately, your best bet is a live-TV streaming service like Sling, YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV for a comprehensive experience. Sling is the cheapest avenue here, with the requisite Orange and Sports Extra plans costing $34 (Sling is currently offering a discount on the first month of Orange). YouTube and Hulu live TV options are both the same price at $83/month (YouTube TV currently discounted to $70 for the first six months), so it’s a matter of which set of content and features you like best. YouTube TV offers a handy multiview tool so you can watch up to four games at once, but Hulu + Live TV comes with Disney+ and ESPN+ (both with ads) for that cost. (Opting for Hulu + Live TV only saves you one whole dollar per month if you don’t include the Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu bundling.) If you’re a more casual fan who can afford to roll the dice on the “select” options on ESPN+, you can save some money. That service only costs $12/month. And if you already have a TV plan that includes the ESPN family of networks, the ESPN app is the best place to watch the tournament. The mix of scores and info, along with multiview streaming for up to four games at a time on Apple TV and Xbox, make the app a well-equipped conduit for the women’s tournament. The March Madness website only shows scores and news for the women’s tournament. There are no live games available on the website. What if I want to stream both the men’s and women’s tournaments? ASSOCIATED PRESS If you’re hoping to stream all of both the men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments, I hope you ordered Samsung’s eight-TV bundle . In terms of streaming services, just jump straight to a live-TV option like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV. I prefer the former because of its multiview feature – a tool that Hulu doesn’t offer. At times when there are multiple games that you want to watch, especially during the first two rounds, you’ll want multiview in order to keep tabs on all of the action. Are any of the March Madness games available to stream for free? You can watch all of the games broadcast on CBS on the March Madness website and mobile apps without a TV provider. Sure, it’s a small sample of the tournament, but it’s completely free and a good option for casual fans who don’t have a paid TV plan they can exploit for more of the action. It’s also a good option for watching the first round at work, if your company hasn’t blocked streaming sites, or if you can discreetly watch on your phone. For the women’s tournament, there aren’t any games available for free. Unless you have an old-school OTA antenna, in which case you can watch men’s games on CBS and women’s games on ABC without any kind of streaming plan. Of course, this is a streaming guide so I’d consider an antenna an extraordinary move in 2025. If you were hoping to use a free trial period to watch March Madness, I’ve got bad news. None of them will be long enough to watch an entire tournament. Some of them don’t offer them at all, but the longest is YouTube TV at 10 days which wouldn’t get you through the second weekend.

    "description": "Microsoft just announced that its Xbox Adaptive Joystick is now available for purchase directly from the company. This news comes during the annual Ability Summit. The Adaptive Joystick is designed for people with limited mobility , so it has four customizable button inputs on the front and two more mappable bumper and trigger-style buttons. It also comes with a standard thumbstick. It costs $30, which is cheaper than the official wireless Xbox controller. That’s just one accessibility-minded announcement that Microsoft made today. The company is bringing AI tools to the screen-reader Narrator for Windows . This will allow the software to offer “rich image descriptions.” It’ll be available to Windows Insider members sometime this spring. Microsoft Teams is also getting an update for those who are hard of hearing. The software will soon be able to automatically recognize when someone is using sign language, placing them prominently as a speaker during the meeting. This is what Sign Language View already does, but it’s an opt-in service. The update streamlines the process. It’ll be available later this year. The company has long been at the forefront of accessibility-related tech. It made a nifty Adaptive Mouse that allows for near-endless customization options. Microsoft also created technology that pairs game controllers without forcing users to touch the console and a kit to make Surface laptops more accessible . The brand first introduced the original Adaptive Controller around six years ago.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-xbox-adaptive-joystick-is-now-available-183009651.html?src=rss",

    "description": "BYD has introduced new technology for charging electric vehicles at vastly quicker speeds. Founder Wang Chuanfu said this &quot;super e-platform&quot; tech offers a peak charging speed of 1,000 kilowatts, twice that of the 500 kw charging currently offered by Tesla&#39;s superchargers. That would mean a car can travel 249 miles (400 kilometers) from a five-minute charge on a BYD station. This charging architecture will initially be available in two of BYD&#39;s vehicle models: the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV. &quot;In order to completely solve our user&#39;s charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,&quot; said Wang. The company is also bringing its quick-charging tech to Chinese drivers for the first time. BYD plans to construct 4,000 ultra-fast charging units across the country, although it did not provide a timeline or budget for the endeavor. To date, owners of BYD vehicles have needed to use charging stations from third-party operators or different EV manufacturers such as Tesla. BYD has been putting more and more EVs on the road around the world. Last year, its second-quarter shipment figures jumped 21 percent to draw very close to Tesla&#39;s numbers.

    "description": "If you&#39;ve ever seen Dyson&#39;s Hot+Cool Jet Focus in a store and wished the ultra-sleek appliance was more affordable, today&#39;s your lucky day. Amazon has the product, which usually costs $470, on sale for $300. That&#39;s nearly a record low. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson&#39;s fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we&#39;ve ever seen this product&#39;s price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we&#39;re nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for.

    "description": "Roku has begun running video ads that automatically play before loading the home screen, as reported by Ars Technica . This is impacting owners of Roku-branded smart TVs and streaming sticks, so long as the device runs the company’s proprietary OS. It’s worth noting that Roku users already see commercials on the home screen itself, so folks have to suffer through an ad to get to the ads. Multiple users have reported seeing commercials for the movie Moana 2 , though there does seem to be an option to close the video. A Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirmed the new ad placement but said it&#39;s just a test. The company declined to comment on whether or not this would become a permanent fixture within the OS. Our business “has and will always require continuous testing and innovation across design, navigation, content, and our first-rate advertising products,” the statement read. “Our recent test is just the latest example, as we explore new ways to showcase brands and programming while still providing a delightful and simple user experience.” Roku is trying pushing how far to enshittify by introducing ad autoplay before the home screen. &quot;I just turned on my Roku and got an unskippable ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.&quot; Speak up before experiment turns into reality. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/NUkmHoemts — Techlore (@TechloreInc) March 18, 2025 As expected, Roku users aren’t exactly pumped about this new ad-delivery method. Some have suggested that they would get rid of their devices if the company keeps the test going. Many consumers have expressed that they are fine with the static ads seen on the home screen, but that a loud video is simply a bridge too far. As a whole, Smart TVs have become a serious growth market for advertisements. These TVs are high-tech and, as such, they track our viewing habits at nearly every turn. Some companies actually lose money on the hardware and make most of their profits via our eyeballs. Roku, as an example, lost $44 million on its physical devices in 2023, but made nearly $1.6 billion with its ads and services products.

    "description": "Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky just unveiled two new smartwatches that will be instantly familiar for long-time fans of the brand. The Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2 boast always-on e-paper displays, long-lasting batteries, physical buttons and simple designs that recall the company’s heyday . This is happening after Google open-sourced PebbleOS, which led Migicovsky to announce his plans to make watches for the platform he helped build. That was just six weeks ago and the units are already ready for pre-orders. He works fast, with a stated reasoning that “no one else has made a perfect smartwatch for people like us, so I’m going to make the exact smartwatch we want.” Eric Migicovsky To that end, the Core 2 Duo looks nearly identical to the iconic Pebble 2, though it has been upgraded with “modern chips and new tricks.” It features a 1.26-inch black and white e-paper display, a microphone, a lightweight polycarbonate frame and an impressive 30-day battery life. It tracks both sleep and steps, and includes a barometer and compass. Pre-orders are open right now , with shipments going out in July. The Core 2 Duo costs $149 and is available in black and white colorways. Eric Migicovsky Migicovsky calls the Core Time 2 his “dream watch” and that it’s the natural evolution from the well-reviewed Pebble Time and the unreleased Pebble Time 2 . It boasts a 64-color 1.5-inch e-paper display, a metal frame and buttons, a flat glass lens for better visibility and a battery that goes for around 30 days. The Core Time 2 also includes a touchscreen, heart rate monitor, microphone and speaker. It boasts IPX8 water-resistance and, of course, access to thousands upon thousands of pre-existing PebbleOS apps. Pre-orders are available now, though shipments won’t go out until December. It’s available in black or white, with a potential third color to be announced in the future, and costs $225. Being as PebbleOS is open-source, both watches are fully hackable. This allows for the potential introduction of custom firmware.

    "description": "Brick-building and monster-catching are about to converge, and parents&#39; wallets aren&#39;t ready. The Lego Group and The Pokémon Company said on Tuesday that their collaboration will bear (plastic) fruit starting next year. It sounds like the ideal companion for the upcoming Lego Game Boy. The companies haven&#39;t yet announced any Lego Pokémon sets — or, for that matter, anything beyond the fact that there is now a partnership and that they&#39;re targeting a 2026 release date. But the tease will likely give countless young (and old!) imaginations plenty to chew on until we know more. Children love building Legos and training Pokémon , so it&#39;s easy to imagine the collab shooting to the top of countless wishlists. While video games based on licensed Lego toy sets have been around for ages, licensed Lego sets based on video games are a newer phenomenon. Lego Minecraft has been around for over a decade , but recent years have also brought sets of Super Mario , Zelda , Overwatch and Sonic the Hedgehog in brick form. &quot;The LEGO Group and Pokémon have strong shared values of imagination, creativity and fun, making this the perfect partnership to deliver unique, meaningful and engaging ways for Trainers to experience the Pokémon brand,&quot; Gaku Susai, Chief Product and Experience Officer at The Pokémon Company International, wrote in a press release. &quot;Working with the best-in-class team at the LEGO Group and seeing their dedication and passion for the project has culminated in an innovative and groundbreaking collaboration that will surprise and delight fans. We cannot wait to see both LEGO fans and the Pokémon community&#39;s reactions in 2026.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lego-pokemon-are-coming-in-2026-154206963.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple just brought its Tap to Pay technology for iPhones to a host of new European countries , including Poland, Switzerland, Finland, Hungary, Portugal and several others. This allows for contactless payments. It works with credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and a number of third-party payment platforms. That last one was once a contentious issue for Apple. The company only allowed third-party developers access to its NFC technology, which powers Tap to Pay, after EU regulators threatened it with a massive antitrust fine . Apple has even agreed to allow users to make third-party wallets their default app. This means that many European customers will now be able to access third-party payment platforms without jumping through any hoops . For instance, iPhone users in Finland will be able to use Tap to Pay with Stripe, SumUp, Viva and many more. Hungarians will be able to use Adyen, Global Payment, myPOS and others. It’s a veritable cornucopia of NFC payment options. Thanks to the EU’s stiff regulations and the region’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), America has also gotten in on the act. The company recently opened up its NFC tech for third-party developers in the US and Canada. This functionality came in a software update as part of iOS 18.1. This feature works in today’s announced European countries so long as the customer has an iPhone Xs or newer and that they are running a recent iOS version. Merchants don’t need any additional hardware to complete transactions. Third-party payment platforms can also integrate Tap to Pay directly into their iOS apps.

    "description": "Just ahead of the Amazon Spring Sale getting underway on March 25, you can sign up for an Audible subscription on the cheap. You can get access to the Premium Plus plan for three months for just $3, or a dollar per month. We&#39;ve seen this deal a few times before. Amazon&#39;s now bringing it back in the lead up to its latest major shopping event, though you&#39;ll have until April 30 to take up the deal. You can cancel the subscription at any time. That&#39;s worth bearing in mind, as after the three months are up, the price will rise to the usual Premium Plus cost of $15 per month. The Premium Plus plan grants you one credit per month. You can use a credit to claim any audiobook you like and you&#39;ll retain access to it even after your subscription expires. In other words, you can permanently add three audiobooks to your collection for $3. The Premium Plus plan also includes access to thousands of other audiobooks. You&#39;ll also be able to listen to Audible Originals as well as podcasts through the service. All of that for a dollar a month is not a bad deal at all.

    "description": "Since the start of March, Google has been aggressively expanding the availability of AI Overviews , dropping the requirement that you need to be logged into your Google account to access the feature. Now the company is bringing yet another AI tool to Search. The next time you go online to find medical information on your phone, you may see a new &quot; What People Suggest &quot; panel at the top of Google. Using AI, the feature will organize &quot;different perspectives from online discussions into easy-to-understand themes,&quot; explains Google. For instance, say you or one of your family members suffers from arthritis, the panel will curate &quot;real insights from people who also have the condition,&quot; with links so you can dig deeper. The feature is currently only available on mobile devices in the US. Google doesn&#39;t say how it plans to prevent the panel from surfacing misinformation. Instead, it mentions that it has worked to improve AI Overviews related to health topics so they &quot;continue to meet a high bar for clinical factuality.&quot; However, even after Google implemented additional safeguards to prevent AI Overviews from generating inaccurate summaries, and began using Gemini 2.0 to tackle more complicated questions, the feature can still return bizarre answers. For instance, an AI Overview recently told my colleague Kris Holt that the first day Canadians can start contributing toward their RRSP for 2026 starts on March 61. At the same event where Google debuted the What People Suggest panel, the company had other health-related announcements. The search giant said it was releasing a series of new Medical Records APIs through its Health Connect platform. With the update, Google says it will be easier to connect your health data with data from your doctor&#39;s office. Google also provided an update on the Pixel Watch 3&#39;s loss of pulse detection feature. After announcing it was coming soon with the latest Pixel feature drop , Google now says it will roll out at end of the month.

    "description": "Several Department of Commerce bureaus are said to have told staff not to use DeepSeek&#39;s AI chatbot on government devices. &quot;To help keep Department of Commerce information systems safe, access to the new Chinese based AI DeepSeek is broadly prohibited on all [government-furnished equipment],&quot; one bureau told staff in an email, Reuters reports. &quot;Do not download, view, access any applications, desktop apps or websites related to DeepSeek.&quot; The extent of any DeepSeek ban within the government as a whole is not yet known. Several states — including New York, Texas and Virginia — have banned DeepSeek from government devices. Some members of Congress and state attorneys general have pushed for legislation to prohibit the generative AI app on federal devices amid concerns over privacy and the security of government data. The emergence of DeepSeek in January as a lower-cost and open-source AI model that can compete with those from the likes of OpenAI and Google saw US tech stocks take a significant hit. The DeekSeek app soared to the top of Apple’s App Store rankings at that time . OpenAI accused Chinese startups of cribbing from its AI models’ copybook and said that it was looking into DeepSeek, among others. The company this month claimed DeepSeek was &quot;state-subsidized&quot; and &quot;state-controlled,&quot; and called for its ban on US government, military and intelligence devices.

    "title": "‘Tesla Takedown’ protesters planning ‘biggest day of action’",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/633091/tesla-takedown-protesters-planning-biggest-day-of-action",
    "description": "People participate in a “Tesla Takedown” protest against Elon Musk outside a Tesla dealership in Pasadena, California, March 8, 2025. Tesla protesters are planning their “biggest day of action” yet, aiming for 500 demonstrations at Tesla showrooms across the world on March 29th, organizers said during a mobilizing call Wednesday. The protests started at a handful of Tesla locations in early February, and has grown to hundreds of locations across the world , as more people have come out to demonstrate against CEO Elon Musk’s dismantling of the federal government. Waving signs and chanting slogans, the so-called Tesla Takedown protesters have become a flashpoint for opposition to Musk’s actions to eliminate federal aid programs and fire tens of thousands of government employees as the head of DOGE , or the Department of Government Efficiency. There have also been an uptick in incidents of arson, vandalism, and violence against Tesla showrooms that, while unrelated to the protests, have led to Musk and President Donald Trump labeling them “domestic terrorism.” Other members of the Trump administration have signaled the protesters could come under scrutiny as well. Attorney General Pam Bondi promised “severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.” The hour-long call, which included actors, filmmakers, members of Congress, federal workers, academics, and journalists, tried to steer clear of Trump’s talk of “terrorism,” keeping the focus on Musk and the effort to tank the company’s stock price. Tesla’s stock has lost nearly 40 percent of its value since the beginning of the year, as poor sales and rising competition in the US and overseas have fueled growing pessimism about the company’s future. “There is no conspiracy, there is no well-funded cabal,” said actor and filmmaker Alex Winter, who helped promote the protests early on on BlueSky. “It&#8217;s just Elon Musk who has taken Tesla down.” Alice Hu, executive director of Planet Over Profit, said that protesters were aiming for 500 events across the world on March 29th, with demonstrations at all 277 Tesla showrooms in the US, as well as hundreds more overseas. Protesters should even feel free to demonstrate at Supercharger stations, she said. “There is no conspiracy, there is no well-funded cabal.” “We need to show Elon that he can throw a tantrum online because his stocks are tainting,” Hu said. “He can get Trump to put on a humiliating used car show in front of the White House. These wannabe authoritarians can try to intimidate us from exercising our First Amendment rights, but they can&#8217;t stop us from fighting back.” Organizers were adamant that their movement was peaceful, often going out of their way to stress the nonviolent nature of the demonstrations. “The things that we&#8217;re fighting for, we are fighting for our country,” Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Tex.) said. “We&#8217;re fighting for democracy. We&#8217;re fighting for our freedoms. And when I say fighting, I&#8217;m saying that figuratively. Obviously, everything that I am promoting is nonviolent.” With Trump promising domestic terrorism charges for violence against Tesla, organizers advised that protesters consult attorneys to better understand the laws in their states. Some states have statutes that could be used to intimidate protesters, so its worthwhile to know what you’re up against, said Lauren Regan, executive director and senior staff attorney at the Civil Liberties Defense Center. She said in her experience, states are often hesitant to prosecute activists because there’s a strong likelihood those statutes will be found unconstitutional. LFG! #teslatakedown GLOBAL DAY OF ACTION March 29Every showroom in America500&#043; around the worldLet&#039;s send these techno-fascists, broligarchs and old fashioned Nazis a message loud and clear. NO WAYPlan an action or find one near you: teslatakedown.com &mdash; #TeslaTakedown (@teslatakedown.com) 2025-03-20T01:48:34.522Z “Their goal is to just pluck a few individuals out and scare the rest of us into submission and apathy,” Regan said. “There are going to be some areas of the country that are very conservative and are gonna be hard on dissidents or activists, no matter what the timing.” The sharp decrease in Tesla’s stock in recent weeks has clearly invigorated the protests. Several speakers spoke of Tesla’s collapse as not only possible, but likely. Micah Lee, an investigative journalist who was among a group of Twitter users to have their accounts banned by Musk shortly after his acquisition of the social platform , said that going after Tesla’s value was a “solid strategy.” “If we kill the Tesla brand, if we drive down the stock price low enough, we can force him to sell his stock to pay back the billions of dollars of debt that he took on to buy Twitter,” Lee said. “This will drive Tesla&#8217;s stock into a death spiral.” Musk’s status as the richest man in the world is largely thanks to Tesla’s stock price. He owns 13 percent of the company, making him the single largest shareholder. As of today, the company is worth $739 billion — down from 1.08 trillion earlier this year, meaning Musk’s stake is worth about $96 billion. And Tesla’s board of directors is composed of close friends and relatives, raising concerns about its independence from the controversial CEO. Several board members, including chair Robyn Denholm and James Murdoch, have sold over $100 million in Tesla stock in recent weeks. “This will drive Tesla&#8217;s stock into a death spiral.” But it’s not clear that hurting Tesla will actually matter much to Musk. He remains in Trump’s good graces, and is wielding vast amounts of control within the federal government. Even if these protests can seriously affect Tesla, Musk has consolidated so much political power that, after a certain point, it’s not clear whether market forces still apply as strongly. Musk’s love of memes — he recently quipped “I am become meme” at CPAC — is a sign that the world’s richest man is living in a different reality than most people , which could be an advantage, said Joan Donovan, an assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University who studies media manipulation, disinformation, and online political movements. “He thinks of himself as this black hat hacker that&#8217;s broken into the government and socially engineered his way into the Treasury and he&#8217;s gonna abscond with all the data, it&#8217;s an obvious data heist,” Donovan said. “But he believes he&#8217;s living in a meme, and so we need to be very clear about what our demands are, about what our bright lines are, and that we&#8217;re not gonna stop until Tesla is done with Musk.”",

    "title": "The best wireless earbuds to buy right now",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds",
    "description": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good of a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.&nbsp; You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts. Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on. Featured in this article How we test wireless earbuds Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, with earbud makers often reserving certain software tricks for their own preferred ecosystem, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms. Comfort No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip I can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one of your ears needs something bigger or smaller than the other. Good sound Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, I care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music I’m listening to. I want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. I look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in my favorite songs. Active noise cancellation What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings. Long battery life Most earbuds these days can reach between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with. Water resistance Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At minimum, you should be looking for earbuds that offer IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life. The best overall wireless earbuds Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L) Just like their predecessors, Sony’s newer WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the 1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on. Some people found the WF-1000XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box. On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 — with substantially better noise cancellation to boot. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth, so you can pair with two devices at the same time. It’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm. Read my&nbsp;full WF-1000XM5 review . The best budget earbuds under $100 Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.&nbsp; And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app. Read my full Nothing Ear (a) impressions . The best noise-canceling earbuds Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job at offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life and putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts. The QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II in terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio. Read my&nbsp;full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review . The best earbuds for sports and working out Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL) After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller. The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users. The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout. If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.&nbsp; Read our full&nbsp;Powerbeats Pro 2 review . The best earbuds for iPhone owners Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) For those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option. The AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you. Where the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem. In the fall of 2024,&nbsp; Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health features &nbsp;for the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss.

The best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint. The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens. But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but I’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it. Read my full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review . The best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise. Google’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors. Got a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package. Read my full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review . The best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) Beats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort. What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing no matter which operating system you’re using. The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Fit Pro; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price. Read my full Beats Studio Buds Plus review . The best earbuds for sound quality Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest. These earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread. Read my&nbsp;full Momentum True Wireless 4 review . The best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone Noise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity. On the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with. Overall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes&#8230; there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lighting port. The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking. Read my full AirPods 4 review . The best earbuds for voice calls on Android Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) Sony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear. The Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for me during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear me without issue, even when I’m answering a quick call on the street.

    "title": "Fired FTC commissioner warns of the ‘corrupting influence of billionaires’",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/632944/democratic-ftc-commissioner-alvaro-bedoya-tech-billionaires-trump",
    "description": "Alvaro Bedoya, commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, July 13, 2023. The Federal Trade Commission chair is set for a grilling by House Republicans who’ve been sharply critical of her approach to antitrust and are sure to raise what they say are management missteps and ethical issues. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump’s sudden and unlawful firing of the Federal Trade Commission’s two remaining Democrats will serve the tech billionaires who backed him, not the American people, warned one of the ousted officials today. “I think we need to be focused on the billionaires over President Trump&#8217;s shoulder at his inauguration and what this attempt will do for them,” Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said in some of his first live remarks since the firing, at a hearing before the Colorado state legislature. “Above all else, we need to be asking ourselves, who will win from this attempt to illegally remove us, and frankly, who will lose?” Bedoya and his fellow Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter were both fired by Trump on Tuesday evening in what they call an illegal removal from an independent agency. Trump&#8217;s move appears to violate the law and a longstanding Supreme Court precedent preventing the president from firing commissioners without cause. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Slaughter warned that their firings are a warning for other government entities that are supposed to be independent. “If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired,” she said, referring to the chair of the Federal Reserve. Are you a current or former FTC employee, or a US federal government worker at another agency? Reach out securely with tips from a non-work device to Lauren Feiner via Signal at laurenfeiner.64. Even though Bedoya and Slaughter would have served in the minority on the FTC, they’ve stressed that such a position is still critical for holding corporations to account. The agency&#8217;s current Republican chair Andrew Ferguson, however, is readily willing to cede more power to the president. As head of the executive branch, Ferguson said in a statement Tuesday, Trump “is vested with all of the executive power in our government. I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government.” Trump hasn’t made his specific reasons for the firings clear, especially since Republicans will soon have a majority on the panel anyway. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement that Trump &#8220;has the lawful authority to manage personnel within the executive branch. President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for.” Bedoya voiced his own suspicions. “I think it&#8217;s interesting that the last public statement I made was critical of one of the men standing behind the President&#8217;s shoulder at his inauguration,” Bedoya told the Colorado legislators — referring to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, one of numerous Big Tech CEOs that prominently attended the event. “It&#8217;s interesting that the last public statement I made was critical of one of the men standing behind the President&#8217;s shoulder at his inauguration” “I issued a statement criticizing Mr. Bezos for working his people and warehouses so fast, so hard that they literally have to put up vending machines on the warehouse floor, dispensing and capping the amount of painkillers each of those workers has to get.” He added that he’s “not alleging that this was why I was fired, but I think it&#8217;s an interesting coincidence.” Bedoya&#8217;s statements were made at what had been originally scheduled as a presentation about the states’ role in protecting Americans’ affordability of goods and cost of living. Bezos isn&#8217;t the only CEO that stands to gain from Democratic commissioners&#8217; dismissals, Bedoya warned. Three of the tech executives who attended Trump’s inauguration — Amazon’s Bezos, X owner Elon Musk, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — each run a company that is subject to a court order or litigation from the FTC. While Trump has railed against &#8220;Big Tech,&#8221; the FTC recently removed guidance on its website that was critical of Amazon, Microsoft, and others. It asked to delay a consumer protection trial over Amazon&#8217;s Prime service due to staffing losses before abruptly reversing course . “I think we need to take a step back and ask ourselves, who will win from this effort to remove us?” “I am sitting as a judge in a matter in which FTC staff is trying to tighten and ramp up the privacy protections for Meta users,” Bedoya said. “I am responsible for enforcing a 20-year privacy consent decree against the company most of us know as Twitter. And I am suing Amazon, Mr. Bezos’ company, in not one, but two separate lawsuits. So I think we need to take a step back and ask ourselves, who will win from this effort to remove us?” More than two dozen Democratic senators, including Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA), sent a letter to Trump urging him to reverse his dismissals. “This action contradicts long standing Supreme Court precedent, undermines Congress’s constitutional authority to create bipartisan, independent commissions, and upends more than 110 years of work at the FTC to protect consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power,” they wrote. “We urge you to rescind these dismissals so the FTC can get back to the people’s work.” But Bedoya made a point to “stress an uncomfortable fact, which is that the issue of the corrupting influence of money in politics, I don&#8217;t think, is limited to one party.” He noted that former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris did not commit to naming President Joe Biden’s FTC Chair Lina Khan to lead the agency again, as big business donors criticized her aggressive approach to merger enforcement, among other things. By contrast, Vice President JD Vance has actually praised Khan in the past —&nbsp;though that obviously didn&#8217;t lead to maintaining her position as chair. “Frankly, I think that has more than anything to do with the amount of money and big money donors that we&#8217;re giving to her campaign,” Bedoya said. “Chair Khan&#8217;s policies were wildly popular in rural America, urban America, suburban America, red, blue, you name it.” “This issue of the corrupting influence of billionaires in law enforcement is an issue that affects all of us,” Bedoya said.",

    "title": "The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones",
    "description": "Whether you’re wearing them for the morning commute, while traveling, or if you’re simply trying to find some peace and quiet while working at home, noise-canceling headphones are a more essential piece of kit nowadays than ever before. And you’ve got a slew of great options to pick from; it’s hard to make a bad choice. There are longtime heavyweights like Bose and Sony to pick from. Apple has quickly carved into the market with the luxurious AirPods Max. And if you’ve got an ear that demands the best audio quality, headphones from Bowers &amp; Wilkins and Sennheiser might appeal to you more than the mainstream contenders. Not everyone loves the feel of earbuds, and there are scenarios where over-ear and on-ear headphones are just simpler or make more sense than wireless buds — particularly if lengthy battery life matters to you. No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed. How we test noise-canceling headphones We put our top picks for noise-canceling headphones through many hours of testing. Since their ability to tamp down the loudness of your surroundings is critical, we use them in a variety of environments — including busy city streets, the office, coffee shops, and public transit — and for more quiet, focused listening at home. We sample their transparency mode to see how clearly the outside world comes through and if it’s easy to carry on conversations while wearing the headphones. We have friends and family try them on and provide feedback on the fit and comfort. And, of course, we have our favorite albums and playlists on repeat to assess how each pair sounds and how much listening time you can expect from a single charge. Comfort If headphones are causing a sore spot at the top of your noggin, what good are they no matter how good they sound or cancel noise? Traditionally the lighter they are, the more comfortable headphones will prove over extended listening sessions. But manufacturers can also help improve comfort by being thoughtful in the materials they choose for ear cups and the headband that wraps over your cranium. Clamping force is another important factor; some headphones will squeeze against your head firmer than others; this can be great if you want a pair to stay put for exercise, but not ideal if you’re just trying to relax and tune out the world. Noise cancellation Practically any of our picks will do an excellent job at providing distraction-free listening when on a flight, at the office, or if you’re traversing city streets. Noise-canceling headphones work by using built-in microphones to listen to the sounds in your environment, and they invert those soundwaves to eliminate the cacophony of everyday life. Sound quality Having powerful noise-canceling used to mean compromising on sound quality, but that’s simply not the case anymore. Most of today’s flagship ANC headphones provide dynamic, rich, and immersive sound. They support a variety of Bluetooth audio codecs, and some (like Sony’s LDAC and aptX HD) can deliver higher bitrates than the status quo AAC and SBC codecs. But don’t get bogged down in those details; headphones that are tuned well with the right components can make your music sound fantastic regardless of codecs. Battery life One benefit of buying headphones instead of earbuds is that they can last much longer on a single charge. Whereas you’ll need to plop most earbuds back into their case after five hours or so, wireless headphones can keep the music going for around 20 hours. And some recent models can even exceed that and hit 40 hours. Multipoint pairing We all try to do our best at multitasking, and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity is essential for headphones to meet the same challenge. Multipoint allows your noise-canceling headphones to pair with two devices at the same time. This makes it easy to take a call on your phone and get right back to the music you were playing on your laptop without fussing with Bluetooth settings menus. Bonus features Headphones are increasingly gaining features that are exclusive to individual manufacturer ecosystems. For example, the AirPods Max are capable of head-tracking spatial audio and other tricks like audio sharing — but only if you’re listening to them with one of the company’s other products, like an iPhone, Mac, or iPad. The “best” headphones for you will differ based on which of those factors you prioritize and care about most, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones remains Sony’s WH-1000XM5 . They offer a combination of sound quality, comfort, and great noise cancellation that’s hard to beat. The best wireless headphones for most people The best noise-canceling headphones for travel The best wireless headphones for iPhone owners The best-sounding wireless headphones The noise-canceling headphones with the best battery life The best wireless headphones for most people Battery life: 30 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC Connectors : USB-C (charging), 3.5mm headphone jack (audio) Sony’s WH-1000XM5 have a completely different design from their predecessors. The changes result in greater comfort when you’re wearing them on your head for extended periods of time — like on a flight or if you’re at the office. Noise cancellation has been further improved from the already-stellar performance of the M4, putting Sony at the front of the pack compared to all major competitors. Sound quality is more detailed and balanced than the older 1000XM4; the low end is still punchy but tighter and less boomy than before. The M5 offer the best voice call performance in the 1000X series to date, and they can connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued in on what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet.&nbsp; Sony’s headphones also include unique features like “speak to chat,” which automatically pauses your music and pipes in ambient audio whenever you start talking. Or you can hold one hand over the right ear cup to activate quick attention mode, which is convenient when grabbing a coffee or listening to airport announcements. And like other high-end headphones, the 1000XM5 can detect when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause. The main downside of the WH-1000XM5 is that, at $399.99, they’re more expensive than prior models. That’s a big reason to consider the 1000XM4 , which were our previous pick for the best noise-canceling headphones. They remain part of Sony’s lineup and can often be found on sale. Read my full Sony WH-1000XM5 review . The best noise-canceling headphones for travel Battery life: 24 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, AAC, SBC Connectors : USB-C (charging), 2.5mm headphone jack (audio) Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are basically a blend of the company’s prior Noise Canceling Headphones 700 and QuietComfort 45 that borrow the best traits from both — while throwing in a new “immersive audio” listening mode. Like past Bose cans, they’re very light and comfortable on your head, even when worn for long stretches of time. Best of all, unlike the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, these can be folded to make them easier to travel with. Their 24-hour battery life is more than adequate, and Bose has added support for the aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec for improved audio fidelity on Android devices. The immersive audio feature works well on some songs, but less so on others. It’s worth experimenting with, but even if you leave it off entirely, you’re left with best-in-class noise cancellation, pleasing sound, and a helpful “aware” transparency mode. Read my full Bose QC Ultra Headphones review . The best wireless headphones for iPhone owners Battery life: 20 hours / Multipoint: No / Audio codecs: AAC, SBC Connectors : Lightning (audio and charging) There was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones in 2020. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls instead of relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes.&nbsp; The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver audio quality that’s up there with the best high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage and fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs. Apple’s noise cancellation is on par with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow their daunting price.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the AirPods Max do have faults. The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they’re designed with Apple’s ecosystem in mind. It gets much harder to justify dropping $550 on them if you live outside the iPhone and Mac universe. Also, it’s worth noting that Apple recently introduced a new pair of the AirPods Max with USB-C charging and five new color options. We haven’t had an opportunity to test them yet, but given just how little they differ from Apple’s existing headphones , we don’t anticipate performance being any different. The question is whether you’re willing to pay the full retail price of $549 to rid your life of Lightning when the original Max can often be found on sale for less than $400, especially during events like Amazon Prime Day. Read my full Apple AirPods Max review . The best-sounding wireless headphones Battery life: 30 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, aptX HD, aptX, AAC, SBC / Connectors : USB-C (audio and charging) If sound quality is priority number one, then Bowers &amp; Wilkins has you covered with the PX7 S2e headphones. They exhibit superb, detailed sound quality that some people prefer to the AirPods Max. The Bowers &amp; Wilkins cans are true to the company’s legacy and style, with a fine-crafted design that exudes quality. And the newer “e” variant has a revamped digital signal processing that can bring out the best audio quality from streaming music. I prefer their physical buttons over the tap/swipe ear cup gestures of Sony’s WH-1000XM5. With 30 hours of battery life, they’re more than competitive with mainstream, less expensive picks. And the sound profile is delightfully warm and will bring out the most from your favorite music. The main downside of the PX7 S2e is that there’s no traditional 3.5mm or 2.5mm output for a headphone cable. You can still listen wired over USB-C, however. Read my full Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX7 S2 review . The noise-canceling headphones with the best battery life Battery life: 60 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, aptX, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (audio and charging), 2.5mm headphone jack (audio) Sixty hours. They can last for up to 60 hours on a single charge. That’s really all you need to know about the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones if you’re looking for an endurance champ. But they also sound terrific and prove extremely comfortable over long listening periods. This combination doesn’t come cheap, but you can find some good occasional deals on them. Sennheiser’s Momentum 4 Wireless headphones edge out Bowers &amp; Wilkins on comfort thanks to their lighter design, and the noise cancellation is slightly better. Next to the Sonys and Bose’s QC Ultra Headphones, it doesn’t get much cozier. These are headphones you can wear for multiple hours without any fatigue or pressure on your ears. Sennheiser’s sound signature is a bit more expressive and puts more emphasis on bass than B&amp;W, but that upper treble range still comes through crystal clear. My only real nitpick with the Sennheisers is that they tend to occasionally power on inside the case and automatically connect to my phone for no apparent reason. Both the B&amp;W and Sennheiser headphones support multipoint connectivity and a range of Bluetooth codecs, including SBC, AAC, aptX, and aptX Adaptive.

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/632881/roborock-saros-z70-robot-vacuum-pre-orders-price",
    "description": "The Roborock Saros Z70 costs $1,899 and will ship beginning in May. This week, Roborock announced that its highly anticipated Saros Z70 is now available for pre-order. The Z70 features a robotic arm and is one of the most expensive robot vacuums in the world, at $1,899 . For the launch, Roborock is sweetening the pot by bundling the new bot with the choice of a free second vacuum cleaner. The company has also finally dethroned iRobot as the number one selling robot vacuum brand globally in both sales volume and revenue , according to analyst firm IDC . Roborock claimed 16 percent of global market share in Q4, while iRobot, which recently announced it’s in financial trouble , managed 13.7 percent. Fellow Chinese company Ecovacs came in third with 13.5 percent. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Verge (@verge) The Saros Z70 was announced at CES this year and is the first mass-produced robot vacuum with a robotic arm . The OmniGrip arm extends from the robot to pick up small items, including socks, tissues, and sandals, to help it clean your home more effectively. The Z70 also boasts 22,000Pa suction power and Roborock’s new StarSight navigation system that combines 3D sensors, cameras, and machine learning to navigate as well as identify and avoid obstacles.&nbsp; The new robot vacuum features an “AdaptiLift Chassis,” which Roborock introduced on the Qrevo Curv and allows the robot to get up and over high transitions between rooms. There’s also two-in-one mopping and vacuuming capabilities and a multifunction dock that cleans the robot’s dual-spinning mop pads and fills its water tank, as well as emptying its dustbin.&nbsp; Roborock is offering those who pre-order the Saros Z70 the choice of a free vacuum, with the option of one of eight of its other models. On offer are several upright wet/dry vacs, plus two brand new robot vacuum models. The Qrevo S5V is a lower-priced version of the Qrevo Curv but without AdaptiLift Chassis, according to Roborock spokesperson Ruben Rodriguez, and the Q10 S5 Plus is a less feature-rich version of the Qrevo Edge . Roborock hasn’t announced pricing for these new Q models, so it&#8217;s not clear how good a deal this is, but the Qrevo Curv retails for $1,599.99. Among the other vacuums it’s bundling is the Dyad Pro Combo , which retails for $659.99. The buy one get one free offer helps somewhat with the sticker shock of the Z70, and until robots can climb stairs (which doesn’t feel that far away), it can be convenient to have a second robot vac.&nbsp;",

    "description": "Newsletter platform Ghost switched on its fediverse connectivity this week, allowing bloggers to share their works across the various social platforms that support the open ActivityPub protocol. Ghost initially promised the feature would go live in 2024. But it’s available now in beta for Ghost(Pro) users, TechCrunch reports . With ActivityPub, users on platforms such as Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Threads can follow and see content from Ghost writers who pay for the “Pro” subscription. Social users can also comment on pieces regardless of which app they’re on. The openness of Ghost helps it stand out against its larger competitor, Substack, which largely blocks its users from sharing posted content off-platform (and makes it tough to leave ). Ghost, however, will let users publish content directly to the fediverse, giving them more freedom. There’s also an “Inbox” where Ghost users can be fed news articles and blogs across Ghost and WordPress. And Ghost has its own social web reader software that can view posts from compatible social media services; notifies you if someone likes, comments, or shares your content; and lets you customize your public profile. However, it doesn&#8217;t work smoothly everywhere, as Meta’s Threads services doesn’t allow Ghost users to interact directly with Threads users. Ghost(Pro) users can activate ActivityPub under Ghost Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Labs.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/632645/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-eero-pro-6e-deal-sale",
    "description": "This deal caught my eye last night. Google is knocking $200 off its flagship Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL , which means the smaller model now starts at $799, or the same price as the regular Pixel 9. That’s a no-brainer right there.&nbsp;Or, you can head to Best Buy where it starts at $749 ($250 off), an all-time low. You pick. The Pixel 9 Pro starts with the same-size 6.3-inch screen as the Pixel 9 but has a sharper and brighter screen, a nicer polished metal frame, and more RAM, which helps allow things to feel smooth and may even futureproof you a little bit with memory-hungry Gemini AI. It also has an added 48-megapixel telephoto lens with 5x zoom and up to 30x digital zoom, compared to the 8x digital zoom on the Pixel 9. That’s a bit of a spec drop on you but the gist is this: it’s a nicer and better phone for the same price, and it’s the one you should buy.&nbsp; “But wait!” you say. “What about the new Pixel 9A Google just announced ?” Yeah, that’s appealing, but it isn’t for sale yet because Google says it’s fixing a hardware issue that recently cropped up. We haven’t had a chance to review it yet, but my quick take is the extra $300 is worth it for the better screen, camera, and extra RAM. More deals to know about Amazon&#8217;s eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi system is 27% off, down to $399.99. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are great if you live in a big house and can’t get a signal in certain dead zones. Or, conversely, if you’re like me and live in a really old house with plaster walls that make it hard for signals to travel through. I place one on each level and the signal carries well through the wood floors to give me full-house coverage. This is the exact system I use and it seems to work well. You might need a case if you’re buying the Pixel 9 Pro above. Casetify is offering 20 percent off if you buy two products and use promo code SpringSale25 before March 26th. I don’t think anyone needs two cases but maybe get one for yourself and hang on to one for Mother’s Day (that’s on May 11th, thank me later.) Or buy a case for something else, like your MacBook, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, or Samsung Galaxy Buds. There are a lot of cool designs to pick from, but know this: the deal doesn’t apply to anything “newly released” or “licensed accessories from brand partners.” The Dreame X30 Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo is on sale for $799 (for Prime members), down from its $1,099.98 starting price. The current Dreame X40 Ultra is our top pick for best robot vacuum and mop hybrid, replacing the version that’s on sale. Our robot reviewer says it’s a “great buy if you can get it on sale” and that it “does everything the X40 Ultra does, just with lower suction power (8,300Pa) and no flexi-arm.” Who needs arms, anyway?",

Announced in an internal memo to Microsoft employees this morning, Hogan will report directly to Nadella and be responsible for strategy and transformation. Hogan has been at Microsoft for more than 20 years and spent the past decade as the company&acirc;&#128;&#153;s chief people officer. She helped usher in a new work culture at Microsoft and took on the head of HR role shortly after Nadella became CEO in 2014. Now, Hogan has to steer strategy through the rapid changes of Microsoft&acirc;&#128;&#153;s AI era. Microsoft hasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t had someone in charge of corporate strategy for quite some time, so this is an interesting change. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;d have to think back to the Mark Penn and Steve Ballmer days to find a role that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s somewhat similar to what Hogan is taking on.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-gtc-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-ai-landscape-san-jose-2025-3",
    "description": "Nvidia&#39;s GTC conference has become a central point in the calendar for the ever-expanding AI industry. Emma Cosgrove Nvidia&#39;s GTC conference in San Jose, California, featured CEO Jensen Huang&#39;s keynote on AI advances. Huang&#39;s speech highlighted Nvidia&#39;s new AI partnerships, software tools, and chip architectures. With crowded sessions and a bustling exhibition floor, Nvidia&#39;s immense growth was on display. The party started as so many do &mdash; with pancakes in a parking lot. I attended Nvidia&#39;s GTC conference, which has taken over downtown San Jose, California, this week. Tuesday was the biggest day for the AI juggernaut. At 10 a.m. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began his keynote address, which lasted more than two and a half hours . But first, breakfast. The legendary Denny&#39;s breakfast It was a chilly early morning in San Jose. The &#34;pregame&#34; started at 6:30 a.m. with breakfast from Denny&#39;s , the restaurant where Huang came up with the idea for Nvidia. I needed to know who would show up more than three hours early for a speech about computer chips. When I arrived just before 7 a.m., the line was already substantial. A massive red mobile Denny&#39;s kitchen was cooking up &#34;Nvidia bytes&#34; &mdash; essentially sausages and pancakes. Diners were encouraged to wrap up their bytes like a taco and add syrup on top, like Huang does. Conference-goers line up outside a Denny&#39;s pop-up restaurant outside Nvidia&#39;s GTC AI event. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider I chatted with some of the early birds. Some were die-hard Nvidia fans. Some were jet-lagged, having flown in the day before from London or Toronto, so they were up anyway. Some wanted to get into the SAP Center as soon as the stadium doors opened to avoid the massive lines that would form the hour before the speech. Some heard a rumor that Huang himself might stop by the tailgate. And sure enough, by 7:25 a.m., muscled men in suits with earpieces started multiplying. With no fanfare, Huang walked out from behind the registration tent wearing his signature uniform, all black and a leather moto jacket. The bleary-eyed crowds sprung into action &mdash; phones up for photos. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made an appearance at the company&#39;s GTC AI conference Denny&#39;s breakfast pop-up. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider Huang donned an apron and went inside the food truck to make some pancakes, as he had as a 15-year-old Denny&#39;s employee . &#34;At this pace, I&#39;d run the company out of business. I used to be a lot faster,&#34; he said of his chef skills after emerging from the kitchen and immediately meeting CNBC reporter Kristina Partsinevelos and a camera crew. Partsinevelos tried to ground the conversation, but Huang was all jokes. &#34;You&#39;re talking about the stock? I&#39;m talking about Denny&#39;s!&#34; he said. By 8:15 a.m., Huang disappeared into the SAP Center, where he turned up on the pre-show panel airing live inside the stadium. Nvidia Jensen Huang served breakfast to the panel on Nvidia&#39;s pregame show at his GTC keynote speech. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider As I reached my floor seat, the panel was giving a reverent retrospective of the company &mdash; including its many brushes with failure before AI changed everything. Huang &#39;without a net&#39; Leading up to the speech, Nvidia&#39;s partner companies were eager to find out if they would garner a mention on one of tech&#39;s brightest stages. One Nvidia employee told me that up to the last minute, a local war room of Nvidia employees was tweaking the company&#39;s dozens of announcements. Once the speech starts, it was all in Huang&#39;s hands. He kicked off by firing T-shirts into the crowd from an Nvidia-green T-shirt cannon. &#34;I just want you to know that I&#39;m up here without a net. There are no scripts, there&#39;s no teleprompter, and I&#39;ve got a lot of things to cover. So let&#39;s get started,&#34; Huang said. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang started his 2025 GTC keynote address by firing T-shirts into the crowd. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider The 62-year-old CEO proceeded to blow through his scheduled two hours. He focused on Nvidia&#39;s advancements, a flurry of new partnerships and software tools for AI developers, and coming chip architectures that could underpin the computation speed and efficiency that creates new industries. These are already creating what Huang calls &#34;AI Factories.&#34; He also spoke on the challenges of realizing the AI-enabled future he has promised for years. He addressed shortages of fresh data to feed AI models, limitations in the ever-important training phase , and energy constraints. In his keynote address, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took the audience on a virtual tour of Nvidia HQ as he moved from subject to subject. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider The world of computing has reached a &#34;tipping point,&#34; and the &#34;platform shift&#34; to accelerated computing is well underway, he said. The crowd stayed rapt, although a little antsy at the two-hour mark. But the final video clip reenergized the room. A Disney-designed robot named Blue , which looked like part of the Star Wars universe, toddled through a desert and then ascended &mdash; for real &mdash; from below the stage. Then the crowd jumped to their feet and raised their phones. &#34;Have a great GTC! Thank you! Hey, Blue, let&#39;s go home. Good job,&#34; said Jensen. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks to the Disney robot &#34;Blue,&#34; which was controlled by Disney Imagineers off-stage at his 2025 GTC keynote. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider &#39;We&#39;re going to have to grow San Jose&#39; After the speech, thousands of attendees streamed into the downtown San Jose streets. The SAP Center, which had only a few empty seats, holds 17,500, and 25,000 people were expected at this year&#39;s event. The crowds made their way back to Plaza de Cesar Chavez, temporarily renamed GTC Park, to find lunch at the procession of food trucks on-site daily. Attendees again had to wait in long lines. Nvidia&#39;s GTC took over downtown San Jose this week. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider The lunch lines were just one of many signs that GTC has outgrown its traditional home. Lines to get into the San Jose Convention Center&#39;s conference sessions snaked through the hallways. Nvidia still calls GTC a developer conference, though the evolution from technical developer confab to serious dealmaking destination was on display at a swanky building next to the convention center dedicated only to business meetings. The elevators couldn&#39;t handle the volume of people constantly coming in and out. Massive queues formed outside the building designated for business meetings at GTC as attendees waited for elevators. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider Even Nvidia team members arriving just behind me balked and abandoned ship to relocate when they saw the lines. Getting from the sidewalk to the meeting room inside the building took 35 minutes. &#34;The only way to hold more people at GTC is we&#39;re going to have to grow San Jose, and we&#39;re working on it,&#34; said Huang during the keynote. Nvidia&#39;s robotic future Logistics aside, I soon met with Kimberly Powell, Nvidia&#39;s vice president of healthcare, who detailed the many ways Nvidia&#39;s accelerated computing is changing how doctors and hospitals work. She said it could be decades before robots can actually perform surgeries without human assistance. But companies like Moon Surgical are already creating surgical assistance robots to hold cameras and tools with arms that never tire. Nvidia also works with da Vinci robots , which can suture wounds, among other tasks. Robotics assistants for surgery are on the way, according to Nvidia. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider I then headed back to the convention center to walk the exhibition floor during happy hour, where I saw some of the technology Powell championed on display. Because Nvidia&#39;s impact spans many industries, the floor showcased cars, vacuuming robots, simulated human bodies ready for surgery, and all the biggest names in cloud computing. Robots from JotBot, Agility Robotics, Unitree, and more were on display at Nvidia GTC. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider I also passed the Nvidia gear store, which was booming. A worker there told me the 2025 GTC T-shirt and puffer vests were the biggest sellers. Nvidia&#39;s store was busy throughout the GTC conference. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider My 12-hour Tuesday at the conference ended at the GTC Night Market back in the park. The setup was an homage to Huang&#39;s love of Taiwan&#39;s night markets, with live music, drinks, local food like bao buns, yakitori, cupcakes, and a punnily-named &#34;juice&#34; bar sponsored by GPU cloud provider Coreweave. Nvidia&#39;s Night Market is inspired by CEO Jensen Huang&#39;s childhood in Taiwan. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider If Nvidia has its way, AI is going to continue to do a lot of hard work for us going forward. But 12 hour - days are here to stay, at least for a while. On my way back to my hotel &mdash; via San Jose bike share past a now-silent SAP Center &mdash; I thought of these two I had spotted inside the convention center: Nvidia&#39;s GTC conference is a marathon, not a sprint.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/telegram-celebrates-1-billion-active-users-pavel-durov-swipe-whatsapp-2025-3",
    "description": "Founder and CEO of Telegram Pavel Durov. Albert Gea/Reuters Telegram reached 1 billion monthly active users, its CEO said. CEO Pavel Durov took a shot at WhatsApp, calling it &#34;a cheap, watered-down imitation of Telegram.&#34; Durov has been allowed to leave France after being held on charges of failing to curb extremist content. Telegram just hit the massive milestone of 1 billion monthly active users. As CEO Pavel Durov shared the news on his personal Telegram channel, he also took a direct shot at his biggest competitor, Meta-owned WhatsApp, which has over 2 billion monthly active users. “Ahead of us stands WhatsApp &mdash; a cheap, watered-down imitation of Telegram,” he wrote. “For years, they’ve desperately tried to copy our innovations while burning billions on lobbying and PR campaigns to slow us down. They failed. Telegram grew, became profitable, and &mdash;unlike our competitor &mdash; retained its independence.” He added in the post that the company has also raked in $547 million in profit in 2024. Durov’s swipe at his rival came just after he was allowed to return to Dubai after being held in France for months. The CEO was arrested in August 2024 after landing in Paris on his private jet. French authorities charged him with multiple offenses , including &#34;complicity&#34; in the distribution of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking on Telegram while refusing to cooperate with the authorities&#39; investigation into the platform. He was released on a $5.6 million bail. Durov has denied the accusations and wrote in a statement on his Telegram channel on September 5, 2024, that holding him responsible for crimes committed by third parties on the platform was both a &#34;surprising&#34; and &#34;misguided approach.&#34; Initially, Durov was barred from leaving France. But the Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed that his judicial restrictions were temporarily lifted from March 15 to April 7, allowing him to travel again. No details were given about the conditions of his release or if he will be required to return. &#34;The process is ongoing but it feels great to be home,&#34; said Durov in a post on his Telegram channel on Monday. Since its launch in 2013 by brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, Telegram has positioned itself as a privacy-first alternative to mainstream messaging apps, with end-to-end encryption for video calls and secret chats that gained a following in countries where speech is more limited. Since Durov’s arrest, Telegram has made some major policy changes, including joining the Internet Watch Foundation &mdash; a group that helps identify and remove child sex abuse content &mdash; and publishing transparency reports that detail how much content it removed, which is a common industry practice. Telegram also announced in September 2024 that it will start sharing IP addresses and phone numbers of offenders with law enforcement when legally required to do so. Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Israel needs US stealth bombers if Trump decides to destroy Iran's nuclear sites",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-needs-us-stealth-bombers-to-destroy-irans-nuclear-sites-2025-3",
    "description": "A potent attack on Iran&#39;s nuclear sites would likely require heavy firepower and bombers like the Northrop B-2 Spirit able to carry it. Senior Master Sgt. Vincent De Groot/US Air National Guard Israel would need US help if it set out to destroy Iran&#39;s underground nuclear sites. The operation would require repeated cruise missile strikes and heavy, bunker-busting bombs. There are limits to what the US and Israel could accomplish in a short air campaign. Iran can enrich enough uranium for a nuclear weapon within weeks. The options to stop Iran from getting a bomb, if it so chooses, are through a nuclear deal like the one President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018 or with overwhelming military force. &#34;There are two ways Iran can be handled, militarily or you can make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal,&#34; Trump said in a March 6 interview with Fox News. The US, he said, has &#34;a situation with Iran that&#39;s going to happen very soon, very, very soon.&#34; Early signs of a deal were inauspicious. Trump dialed up the pressure on Iran after US strikes on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen over the weekend, warning in a Monday Truth Social post that &#34;every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN.&#34; Israel could attempt pre-emptive strikes, but they would likely need US airpower in what would be a major escalation if they aimed to demolish Iran&#39;s underground facilities for weapons-grade uranium, according to military analysts. To wipe out Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities, US and Israel would need to carry out repeated strikes with stand-off weapons like cruise missiles, Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company RANE, told Business Insider. Such strikes could also require the Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . The B-2 is the only aircraft that can carry the US&#39;s 15-ton GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, the largest US bunker buster, and one of the most powerful non-nuclear bombs. A B-2 notably bombed hardened underground weapon sites belonging to the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen in October. &#34;It would be a major milestone in the history of warfare should we see a joint Israeli-US strike on Iran,&#34; Bohl said. &#34;It would give us insight into how such (American-made) systems might also perform against, say, Russia and China, whose systems are in some ways similar to that of Iran&#39;s.&#34; The United Nations Security Council discussed Iran&#39;s enrichment of uranium near weapons-grade level in a closed meeting on Wednesday. The US accused Iran of &#34;flagrantly&#34; defying the council over its rapid uranium enrichment. The Juniper Oak exercises were the largest joint exercises in US-Israeli history. They included aircraft like Israeli Air Force F-16s. Senior Airman Jacob Cabanero/US Air Force Amid the back and forth between the Trump administration and Iran, a US Air Force B-52 Stratofortess bomber drilled with Israeli Air Force F-35 stealth jets and F-15 fighters. Both air forces have drilled on numerous occasions in recent years in preparation for a possible attack against Iran. The largest-ever exercise was Juniper Oak in January 2023 , when American and Israeli F-35 stealth jets, drones, and US strategic bombers dropped over 180,000 pounds of live munitions. &#34;Juniper Oak gave us insight into how a maximum escalation scenario might play out with joint Israel-US operations,&#34; Bohl said. Why Israel would likely need US bombers Israel&#39;s fighter fleet consists of fourth-generation American-made F-15 and F-16 jets and more advanced fifth-generation F-35s made by Lockheed Martin. Israel doesn&#39;t have heavy bombers capable of carrying large bunker-buster munitions. The two primary targets of any strikes would be the Natanz and Fordow underground enrichment facilities. Natanz is deep underground and shielded by reinforced concrete in the central Isfahan province. Satellite imagery taken in 2023 indicated Iran has dug tunnels near the site too deep for even the GBU-57 to damage effectively. Fordow is the country&#39;s second uranium enrichment facility, which Iran dug inside a mountain to build near the holy city of Qom. US-Israeli airstrikes would have to be part of a larger, complex campaign that also targets Iranian air defenses and ballistic missiles with air and ship-launched munitions, drones, cyberattacks, and possibly limited special operations raids, according to Nicholas Heras, senior director of strategy and innovation at the New Lines Institute. Israel already inflicted widespread damage on Iran&#39;s Russian-made S-300 air defenses during its October 26 airstrikes . Another round of strikes, especially with American participation, could prove much more devastating. &#34;Iran is on the back foot defending its airspace,&#34; RANE&#39;s Bohl said. While Iran&#39;s antiquated air force is outclassed and outgunned by the USAF and IAF, there are still limits to what the latter&#39;s cutting-edge airpower can achieve, especially if America and Israel are reluctant to conduct a long campaign. And if a US-Israeli campaign does not broadly target Iran&#39;s military arsenal, Tehran could mount substantial retaliation. For years, the country has possessed the largest arsenal of ballistic missiles in the region. While these missiles failed to inflict significant damage during Iran&#39;s April and October 2024 attacks against Israel, they could still menace US bases in the Middle East or force Israel to expend more of its expensive and finite high-altitude Arrow anti-ballistic missile interceptors in order to fend them off. Iran has had decades to prepare for such an attack. It&#39;s possible &#34;Iran is able to weather the worst of it and rebuild,&#34; since bombs and missiles can fail to destroy all of the Iranian centrifuges used to enrich uranium, Bohl said. Either way, a joint air assault against Iran could prove unprecedented. &#34;Without a doubt, a joint US-Israel military campaign against Iran&#39;s nuclear program would be one of the largest, and certainly the most technologically advanced, in human history,&#34; New Lines Institute&#39;s Heras said.

    "description": "Baseball legend Jackie Robinson&#39;s page on the Department of Defense&#39;s website was briefly removed and then restored. Hulton|Archive/Getty Images Jackie Robinson&#39;s page was briefly removed from the Department of Defense website. The Pentagon has been removing pages to comply with Trump&#39;s anti-DEI executive orders. It has since restored the page, saying it salutes Robinson&#39;s heroic service to the country. A webpage dedicated to American baseball legend Jackie Robinson was removed and then restored to the Department of Defense&#39;s website. To comply with President Donald Trump&#39;s anti-DEI executive orders, the Pentagon has been scrubbing its website of articles, photos, and videos that it says promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Robinson&#39;s page, which was part of a &#34;Sports Heroes Who Served&#34; series, was one of those briefly removed. It&#39;s not clear exactly how long the page was down, but one journalist posted a screenshot on Bluesky on Tuesday morning showing a &#34;404 Page Not Found&#34; error message across the page with &#34;dei&#34; inserted in the URL. The famed Brooklyn Dodgers player&#39;s page has since been restored, and Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot confirmed the error on Wednesday in a statement shared with Business Insider. Ullyot&#39;s statement notes that, in some &#34;rare cases,&#34; content outside the scope of the directive gets removed &#34;either deliberately or by mistake.&#34; &#34;Everyone at the Defense Department loves Jackie Robinson, as well as the Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee Airmen, the Marines at Iwo Jima, and so many others &mdash; we salute them for their strong and, in many cases, heroic service to our country, full stop,&#34; Ullyot said in the statement. Robinson&#39;s now-restored page details his life and accomplishments, from growing up in California in the 1920s to serving in World War II to his illustrious baseball career, first in the Negro Leagues and then as one of the first Black players in Major League Baseball. Robinson was also a prominent leader in the Civil Rights movement. &#34;We do not view or highlight them through the prism of immutable characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, or sex,&#34; Ullyot&#39;s statement continues. &#34;We do so only by recognizing their patriotism and dedication to the warfighting mission like every other American who has worn the uniform.&#34; Robinson&#39;s page repeatedly references his race and the struggles he faced as a Black man, including &#34;hatred from fans&#34; and being told that he&#39;d have to &#34;be willing to withstand the inevitable racial abuse directed at him.&#34; It&#39;s not clear why Robinson&#39;s page was removed or if the department intends to remove references to Robinson&#39;s race from the webpage to comply with Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth&#39;s anti-DEI directives. When reached for comment, the Department of Defense did not answer whether it plans to alter the page&#39;s content. In his statement, Ullyot called DEI &#34;Discriminatory Equity Ideology,&#34; adding that it&#39;s &#34;a form of Woke cultural Marxism that Divides the force, Erodes unit cohesion and Interferes with the services&#39; core warfighting mission.&#34; A spokesperson for the Jackie Robinson Foundation was not available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.

    "title": "Frank founder Charlie Javice says feds won't let JPMorgan fraud jury see her website &mdash; and asked for a mistrial",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/frank-founder-charlie-javice-asks-for-mistrial-jpmorgan-fraud-case-2025-3",
    "description": "Charlie Javice wanted a mistrial. John Minchillo/Associated Press Federal prosecutors say Charlie Javice tricked JPMorgan into paying $175M for her startup, Frank. At her New York fraud trial on Wednesday, her lawyers asked, without success, for a mistrial. They said prosecutors are hiding a key &#34;witness&#34; from jurors: the Frank website itself. Federal prosecutors are hiding an important &#34;witness&#34; from the jury at Frank founder Charlie Javice&#39;s New York fraud trial , her lawyers said Wednesday &mdash; the Frank website itself. The website, which helped students apply for college financial aid, was shut down in November 2022, a year after JPMorgan Chase purchased it for $175 million. Javice is on trial for allegedly clinching the deal by fraudulently exaggerating Frank&#39;s value, claiming the website had 4.25 million users when it only had 300,000. On Wednesday morning, lawyers for Javice filed a motion demanding a mistrial, saying prosecutors failed to show jurors key content from the website that could help clear their client. The motion cites undated pages from the defunct site in which Javice, the lawyers say, was frank about Frank. &#34;Frank has helped over 250,000 families,&#34; one page cited in the motion reads. &#34;Frank is an online tool that has helped 300,000 students maximize their financial aid for college,&#34; another page said. &#34;This case is about whether Ms. Javice misrepresented metrics related to the Frank website,&#34; defense lawyers from the Miami-based firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan wrote the judge. &#34;Yet, the website has been the equivalent of the missing key witness,&#34; they wrote. &#34;An exculpatory one, at that.&#34; The motion didn&#39;t address why the defense couldn&#39;t simply show any useful web pages to jurors themselves. Nor did it succeed in stopping the trial &mdash; testimony continued without it being discussed in court. Prosecutors did not file a response. During a month of testimony, they have shown jurors thousands of pages of emails and spreadsheet evidence in which JPMorgan Chase executives were assured that Frank&#39;s users numbered in the millions. Though it apparently fell flat, the mistrial motion provided the best glimpse yet into the defense strategy. &#34;The Frank website is directly relevant to two of Ms. Javice&#39;s legal defenses: lack of intent and materiality,&#34; the motion says. The fintech entrepreneur had no intention of hiding Frank&#39;s true user base from the bank &mdash; instead, &#34;she was proud of it,&#34; the motion says. &#34;Ms. Javice displayed it multiple places on the Frank website.&#34; As for materiality &mdash; meaning whether the alleged exaggeration of user numbers was a material, or meaningful, reason JPMorgan purchased Frank &mdash; here, too, the website clears her, the lawyers argue. The bank would have been &#34;on notice&#34; that Frank had 300,000 user accounts just from looking at the website, the motion said. Last week, in another defense filing, Javice&#39;s lawyers said they&#39;ll argue that the 4.25 million figure referenced website traffic, not user accounts. And in defense opening statements, jurors were told that the bank was really looking to acquire Javice, not her data. The young entrepreneur is an &#34;incredible young woman&#34; who&#39;d made the Forbes &#34;30 Under 30&#34; list and who, at age 28, secured a one-on-one meeting with Jamie Dimon , JPMorgan&#39;s CEO, lawyer Jose Baez said in openings. Charlie Javice sold Frank to JPMorgan Chase for $175 million. Charlie Javice A Land Rover and Lululemon For the jury, Wednesday was another day of looking at document evidence. Rachel Danko, an investigative analyst for the US attorney&#39;s office, spent all day on the witness stand, showing jurors months of texts, emails, and spreadsheets that prosecutors say prove the conspiracy. Jurors were not shown the trial&#39;s most controversial texts, which have been barred as evidence. They include one in which Javice complains about the sentence of Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes , calling the defrauded investors in that case, &#34;sophisticated assholes.&#34; In another text kept from jurors, Javice calls her second-in-command at Frank, Olivier Amar, &#34;the best partner in crime.&#34; The two are now co-defendants facing up to 30 years prison on charges of conspiracy and bank fraud The evidence jurors did see on Wednesday revealed more of the close working relationship between Javice and Amar as they rushed to send JPMorgan the data the bank demanded. The two also used WhatsApp to celebrate their $175 million windfall. Jurors saw text exchanges between Javice and Amar in which they commiserate about their days of anxiety and nights of sleeplessness. In the texts, they share jokes and the occasional smiley and winky emojis. Javice kidded Amar about a new Land Rover he planned to buy if the deal went through, and joked about a new shipment of company &#34;swag&#34; &mdash; sweatshirts made by Lululemon and bearing the &#34;Frank&#34; logo. &#34;Better pick up the Land Rover in a Frank Lulu sweatsuit :p &#34; Javice texted Amar on August 3, 2021, after he texted that payment had just gone through on what prosecutors say was a fake database of 4.25 million students. &#34;Score. Call me,&#34; she texted Amar after the payment cleared. Days later, JPMorgan finalized its acquisition offer. Federal prosecutors said they expect to finish presenting their direct case on Thursday. Neither defense team has said on the record whether defense witnesses would be called. US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said earlier this week that he expects trial testimony to conclude by the end of the week. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/deloitte-principal-says-consultants-ai-technologists-first-2025-3",
    "description": "Jillian Wanner spoke about the transformation Deloitte is going through as the consulting industry shifts to an AI-first mindset. NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images Deloitte principal Jillian Wanner said the firm is shifting to an engineering-first mindset. Wanner said consultants need to be using generative AI to automate tasks. Deloitte has unveiled several AI-powered tools over the past year as it makes a cultural shift. The modern consulting playbook may be evolving from spreadsheets and Powerpoints. In a Wednesday panel at Nvidia&#39;s GTC conference about empowering the federal workforce with AI, Deloitte principal Jillian Wanner said the consulting industry as a whole is being &#34;disrupted&#34; amid AI transformations. &#34;It is no longer acceptable at Deloitte to not take an engineering first mindset,&#34; Wanner, who helps lead AI staff development at Deloitte, said. As the industry shifts, Deloitte employees need to act as &#34;technologists and engineers first,&#34; and &#34;consultants second.&#34; Deloitte is one among several big consulting firms that&#39;s invested billions into transforming itself &mdash; and its clients &mdash; with generative AI in recent years. The firm is one of the main providers for the federal government, which spends billions each year on consulting services . It brings in about $3.3 billion annually in federal contracts &mdash; slightly under 10% of its annual revenue for the 2024 fiscal year. Wanner said she&#39;s seen a significant acceleration and adoption of generative AI among Deloitte&#39;s federal clients within the past six to twelve months. &#34;There has been a wholehearted embrace of rethinking about what are the things we do today that require intensive, manual, rote steps,&#34; she said. Whether those are administrative tasks or ones that involve documentation, Wanner said, &#34;we can start to immediately empower agents, or generative AI solutions, or platforms, that can start to automate a lot of these functions.&#34; She added, &#34;There&#39;s a significant amount of low-hanging fruit that could translate into some pretty significant value.&#34; In recent years, Deloitte has introduced a suite of AI-powered tools to help workers make this shift. In 2023, it introduced an internal chatbot called &#34;DARTbot&#34; capable of &#34;generating intelligent responses and providing valuable insights&#34; to assist the firm&#39;s nearly 18,000 Audit &amp; Assurance professionals in the US. The company also said it was introducing &#34;purpose-specific&#34; large language models and chatbots to help support specialized teams. Last January, it also unveiled &#34;NavigAite&#34; a generative AI tool to help with tasks like document summarization and review. That same month, for its 75,000 staff members in the Middle East, Europe, and UK, it also rolled out an internal AI chatbot to help staff automate tasks like writing emails and creating project plans. The consultancy has partnered with Nvidia to deploy digital AI agents. It also announced on Tuesday it will be collaborating with the chipmaker on its new reasoning models and software. Deloitte did not respond to a request for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/ben-and-jerrys-unilever-ousted-ceo-silenced-mission-court-docs-2025-3",
    "description": "Ben and Jerry&#39;s is litigating with its parent company, Unilever. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s accused its parent company, Unilever, of ousting its CEO, court documents show. Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s suit against Unilever, which is ongoing, accused it in a new filing of silencing activism. Attorneys for Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s said activism is integral to its brand, attracting customers. Ice cream brand Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s accused its parent company Unilever of ousting its chief executive, according to new court filings. The removal of CEO David Stever came after disagreements over the ice cream brand&#39;s commitment to social and political activism, which Unilever intended to &#34;silence,&#34; attorneys for Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s said in a motion filed on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York as part of an ongoing lawsuit between the two. &#34;Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever&#39;s efforts to silence the Social Mission,&#34; attorneys for Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s said in the lawsuit. &#34;Unilever&#39;s motive for removing Mr. Stever is his commitment to Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s Social Mission and Essential Brand Integrity.&#34; Unilever informed the Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s Independent Board, which manages its social brand and mission, on March 3 that it would be replacing Stever, the filing said. Stever served as the company&#39;s chief executive since May 2023 after spending decades working up the ranks of the company, according to multiple reports. It was not immediately clear if Stever&#39;s removal was fully completed. Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s attorneys alleged there were breaches in the approved process of a chief executive&#39;s removal and motioned for the courts to prompt Unilever to &#34;comply with the CEO appointment and removal procedure.&#34; In response to a request for comment from Business Insider, Unilever leveled similar allegations toward Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s, stating that &#34;decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s CEO will be made by Unilever after good faith consultation and discussion with the B&amp;J&#39;s Independent Board.&#34; &#34;Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public. We hope that the B&amp;J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process,&#34; a Unilever spokesperson said in a statement. Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Unilever acquired Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s in 2000 for $326 million. But the relationship has recently become tense over political issues. In 2021, for example, the ice cream company tried to stop selling in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In November, Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s sued Unilever, accusing it of silencing its political statements on the Gaza war. Tuesday&#39;s filing is part of that lawsuit. On its social media accounts, Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s touts a litany of progressive social justice ideals, including voting rights, LGBTQ and BIPOC rights, and immigrant and refugee rights. The activism is &#34;core to Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s DNA,&#34; and a &#34;key part of its business&#34; in attracting customers, the company&#39;s attorneys said in the lawsuit. &#34;Consequently, every act of muzzling, suppressing, or publicly undermining the company&#39;s social activism causes real, calculable, and significant financial and reputational harm to Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s,&#34; the ice cream company&#39;s attorneys said in the lawsuit. March 19, 2025 &mdash;&nbsp;This story has been updated to include a comment from Unilever sent after publication. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/good-american-family-true-story-natalia-grace-barnett-2025-2",
    "description": "Imogen Faith Reid, Ellen Pompeo, and Mark Duplass star in Hulu&#39;s &#34;Good American Family.&#34; Disney/Ser Baffo &#34;Good American Family&#34; premiered this week. The new Hulu show is based on the true story of Ukrainian orphan Natalia Grace Barnett. Ellen Pompeo plays Kristine Barnett, Natalia Grace&#39;s adoptive mother, who said the girl was really an adult. The true story behind the new Hulu show &#34;Good American Family&#34; proves that reality can be stranger than fiction. The series, which premiered its first two episodes on Wednesday, opens with married parents Kristine ( Ellen Pompeo ) and Michael Barnett (Mark Duplass) struggling in the aftermath of an adoption that fell through. Their luck seems to turn around when Kristine receives a call from an adoption agency that a Ukrainian orphan urgently needs a new home &mdash; a little girl named Natalia Grace (newcomer Imogen Faith Reid). Here&#39;s what you need to know about the new show, including the real people the show is based on and the complicated true story behind it. Natalia Grace&#39;s adoptive parents said she was an adult posing as a child Natalia Grace&#39;s story was first publicized in 2019 after her adoptive parents were charged with neglect, which they denied. Kristine and Michael Barnett, an Indiana couple who have since divorced, adopted Natalia in 2010. At the time, they were told that the girl, who has a form of dwarfism, was 6 years old. The Barnetts said they came to believe that Natalia, who they said had menstrual periods and pubic hair, was really a grown woman with a mental illness. Kristine Barnett said that Natalia terrorized their family, trying to kill them and pouring bleach into her coffee. The Barnetts successfully petitioned the court to change Natalia&#39;s legal age from 8 to 22 in 2012, making her a legal adult. They then put Natalia up in an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, in 2013 and moved their family to Canada. Natalia, who has always maintained she was a child , was left to fend for herself for years. She ended up in the care of Cynthia and Antwon Mans, another couple with multiple adopted children. After a yearslong investigation, the Barnetts were charged with neglect. Michael was acquitted of the charges in October 2022, and the charges against Kristine were dismissed in March 2023. Natalia Grace&#39;s story was previously told in a multi-season docuseries Natalia Grace on &#34;The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks.&#34; Investigation Discovery The convoluted saga was previously unpacked in a docuseries, &#34;The Curious Case of Natalia Grace,&#34; which aired for three seasons on Investigation Discovery from 2023 to 2025. The series focused on the perspectives of several key people involved in the story. The first installment told the backstory of the case and largely focused on Michael Barnett&#39;s perspective and the Barnetts&#39; argument that Natalia was an adult. Natalia didn&#39;t participate in that installment but was the central focus of a follow-up, dubbed &#34;The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks,&#34; in 2024. &#34;Natalia Speaks&#34; presented the story from her perspective, saying Kristine Barnett had been abusive to her and had concocted the story (which had eerie similarities to the plot of the 2009 horror movie &#34;Orphan&#34; ) in order to get rid of her. It even featured a confrontation between Natalia and Michael, who apologized to his former adoptive daughter for his actions and said he&#39;d also been abused by Kristine. The second installment appeared to end happily, with Natalia getting closure from Michael Barnett, taking a DNA test to determine her true age , and being formally adopted by the Mans family. However, the shocking ending of &#34;Natalia Speaks&#34; included a phone call that implied Natalia was at odds with the Mans family as well. The &#34;Final Chapter,&#34; an additional four episodes released in January 2025, followed Natalia&#39;s friction with Cynthia and Antwon Mans . She left them to live with Nicole and Vince DePaul, a couple with dwarfism who&#39;d previously tried to adopt Natalia before the Barnetts did. Nicole DePaul accused Cynthia and Antwon Mans of stealing Natalia&#39;s money, which the Mans family has denied. Today, Natalia is still living with the DePaul family , has a long-distance boyfriend in the UK named Neil , and apparently is estranged from the Manses, who remain her legal parents. Kristine Barnett has maintained in public social media posts that Natalia was an adult all along, calling her former adoptive daughter a &#34;sociopath,&#34; and has denied all abuse allegations. &#39;Good American Family&#39; has been in development for years &mdash; long before the docuseries aired Imogen Faith Reid plays Natalia Grace Barnett. Disney While the Natalia Grace case exploded with the premiere of the ID docuseries in 2023, showrunner Katie Robbins told Business Insider she was first approached by Hulu to do a narrative version of the story in 2020. By that time, the charges against the Barnetts had been publicized, and the show&#39;s research team was on the ground at their trials in Indiana. They were able to gather information from discovery, including depositions, medical records, Facebook messages, and texts that gave them insight into the story. Crucially, &#34;Good American Family&#34; is formatted to shift between perspectives, starting off from the point of view of Kristine Barnett and presenting a devious Natalia and sympathetic Kristine before shifting over to Natalia&#39;s perspective. Robbins had plenty of experience with that format &mdash; she&#39;d previously worked on the dueling-narratives Showtime drama &#34;The Affair&#34; (as did Robbins&#39; &#34;Good American Family&#34; co-showrunner and fellow executive producer, Sarah Sutherland). For Robbins, the idea to tell the story this way arose when she was doing initial research into the case. She realized that her understanding of the story was colored differently depending on what she was reading or watching about it. &#34;I&#39;d read an interview and I&#39;d be like, OK, this is what this is,&#34; Robbins told BI. &#34;And then I&#39;d go and watch an interview on television with a different person involved in the story and I&#39;d be like, oh my gosh, I was totally wrong. It&#39;s actually this .&#34; She describes the story as a Rorschach test, where people interpret the truth differently based on how the information is presented alongside their own personal biases and experiences. Interestingly, the telling of the real story similarly kept shifting in the ID docuseries about Natalia, with twists, turns, and shocking cliffhangers. Robbins confirmed that the docuseries premiered as she and her writers were in the process of writing and then shooting the scripted drama. &#34;The Final Chapter,&#34; which threw into doubt the relationship between Natalia and the Mans family, who adopted her after her abandonment by the Barnetts, premiered after they&#39;d finished post-production. Despite the updates that the final chapter provided, it didn&#39;t necessitate rewrites or reshoots; they&#39;d already had all the information they needed to tell their story. Input from the real people involved also didn&#39;t change anything, because neither the showrunners nor the cast spoke to Natalia or the Barnetts. &#34;We would&#39;ve loved to talk to Natalia, but that wasn&#39;t possible,&#34; Robbins told BI. &#34;And so that just made the research so essential in order to try to do justice to the story.&#34; &#34;Good American Family&#34; airs Wednesdays on Hulu , with new episodes premiering weekly.

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says every company will become an 'AI factory.' Here's what he means.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-ai-factory-tokens-2025-3",
    "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers the keynote address during the GTC 2025 conference in San Jose. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts companies will become AI factories that generate tokens. Tokens are numerical representations used by AI models to process and understand data. Here&#39;s what the Nvidia CEO means by an &#34;AI factory.&#34; In his keynote at Nvidia &#39;s AI conference this week, CEO Jensen Huang predicted every company will become an &#34;AI factory.&#34; It&#39;s a big idea that could make businesses of all types successful in the future. So it&#39;s worth explaining. I first heard about this last year when chatting with Guillermo Rauch , CEO of AI startup Vercel. He explained the role of tokens in artificial intelligence, and noted that Huang likes to say &#34;every company will become a token factory.&#34; &#39;Everything&#39;s token&#39; If data is the raw material &nbsp;of generative AI, tokens are the language. AI models break down words and other inputs into numerical tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about ¾ of a word. An example from Nvidia: The word&nbsp;&#34;darkness&#34; might be tokenized into the numbers 271 for &#34;dark&#34; and 655 for &#34;ness.&#34; The opposite word, &#34;brightness,&#34; would be represented by 491 and 655. This way, the AI model can spot the same 655 number twice and understand that these words are related.&nbsp; Trillions of these numbers, or tokens, are used to train AI models like this, then fine-tune and run them. Instead of &#34; everything&#39;s computer ,&#34; you might say that &#34;everything&#39;s token&#34; in AI. &#39;One job and one job only&#39; Huang, Rauch, and other technologists think modern companies will succeed by generating the most tokens. They will be AI factories churning out tokens that will be used to improve and run AI systems that help businesses make better products and services. &#34;I call them AI factories,&#34; Huang said on Tuesday at the GTC conference. &#34;They&#39;re AI factories because they have one job and one job only &mdash; generating these incredible tokens that we then reconstitute into music, into words, into videos, into research, into chemicals or proteins.&#34; He said these token-generating facilities will sometimes sit alongside companies&#39; more traditional operations. &#34;Every industry, every company that has factories will have two factories in the future,&#34; Huang predicted. &#34;The factory for what they build and the factory for the mathematics, the factory for the AI.&#34; He cited auto manufacturing as an example, describing &#34;a factory for cars&#34; and &#34;a factory for AI for the cars.&#34; He then put some meat on those theoretical bones by announcing a partnership with General Motors in which Nvidia will help that company use AI to manufacture cars while also making GM vehicles more autonomous with AI. &nbsp; Does Tesla make cars or token-generating machines? Jason Liu,&nbsp;a machine-learning engineer and AI consultant, made a similar point with Tesla&#39;s electric vehicles and Elon Musk&#39;s goal to make them fully autonomous. &nbsp; When a Tesla is driven around a city, it has sensors that collect mountains of information about its surroundings. That data is collected and turned into tokens that are used to improve Tesla&#39;s AI models. That, in theory, produces better self-driving software to guide the vehicles more accurately and safely. In an AI world, most companies&#39; roles will be to generate more data,&#34; Liu said. He argued that Tesla&#39;s approach of putting as many cars as possible on the road to scoop up as much data as possible has been better than Waymo&#39;s strategy, &#34;where engineers sat in a cave for years working on this in relative isolation, not collecting as much data, or tokens.&#34; Making better business decisions Liu shared another example, this time theoretical: How can companies make better business decisions by looking back at their process and tokenizing it? &#34;For any major decision, there&#39;s probably six months of back and forth debate between employees on Slack chats, Zoom video meetings, board meetings, and data dashboards,&#34; he said. Companies can now turn all that into tokens and use that to train an AI system to make better decisions in the future or to help human executives and employees make better decisions next time. &#34;The job of the company and the software is to pull all that out of the humans involved and turn that into tokens for AI training,&#34; he added.&nbsp; Token factory examples Rauch says Vercel is doing this with its v0 tool, which helps developers and non-technical people build websites and applications. &nbsp; &#34;v0 takes in user requirements in English and outputs an application,&#34; Rauch explained. &#34;Those are our tokens.&#34; How also cited a Vercel customer called OpenEvidence, which uses AI to synthesize mountains of medical research into digestible information for busy medicine professionals.&nbsp; &#34;Their tokens are the research data that doctors need in order to make better decisions,&#34; Rauch said. &#34;It&#39;s medical intelligence tokens.&#34; Liu cited the example of Mercor, a startup that is&nbsp; hiring technical PhDs to harvest their specific knowledge and turn that into tokens that are used by AI labs to improve their models. &#34;The job of every company will become to produce intelligence, like a token factory,&#34; Rauch said. &#34;Companies build up institutional knowledge over time, they accrue best practices, operational principles and procedures, training manuals, brand guidelines, and even taste. All of that will become part of the pre- and post-training of AI models and the data that gets inserted on top.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Star Wars BDX droids at Disney&#39;s &#34;Season of the Force&#34; event. Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images Disney is partnering with Nvidia and Google DeepMind to create an open-source physics engine. The engine will help robots learn to navigate complex tasks. Disney hopes to feature entertainment robots at its theme parks. On stage during a keynote speech this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke to an adorable robot named Blue, which responded in classic &#34;bee-boop&#34; robot language. It was a modern meet cute. Jensen introduced the robot at Nvidia&#39;s GTC AI Conference &mdash; which some are calling the Super Bowl of AI &mdash; on Tuesday in San Jose, California. Huang said Disney Research is partnering with Nvidia and Google DeepMind to develop Newton, an open-source physics engine to help robots like Blue learn to navigate complex tasks more accurately. Newton is built on the Nvidia Warp framework. Disney Research plans to use the advanced technology to upgrade its robotic characters to be more lifelike and expressive. &#34;Disney Research will be the first to use Newton to advance its robotic character platform that powers next-generation entertainment robots,&#34; a press release said. An Nvidia spokesperson told BI that the first conversation between the company, Google Deepmind, and Disney Research took place in December. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang interacts with a robot at the company&#39;s AI conference. JOSH EDELSON / AFP The audience attending Huang&#39;s keynote address clapped and cheered when Blue, a droid inspired by &#34;Star Wars,&#34; walked onstage. The droids, which have not used Newton yet, will be coming to Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris this year. A squad of the droids appeared with Jon Favreau and Disney Imagineers at the 2025 SXSW Conference &amp; Festivals . Disney Imagineers first revealed the robots at a Disney event in 2023. During the demonstration, three robots roamed around the &#34;Star Wars: Galaxy&#39;s Edge&#34; attraction at Disney&#39;s Hollywood Studios. While Disney has used audio-animatronic figures in its park attractions for decades, the new droids would elevate the company&#39;s robot game to a new level. Huang and Blue had a brief conversation during the presentation. Blue responded to Huang&#39;s questions with beeps, head nods, and body wiggles. The robots were remote-controlled by a human at the event. Disney BDX Droids at Nvidia&#39;s conference on Tuesday. Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider &#34;This is how we&#39;re going to train robots in the future,&#34; Huang said, adding that two Nvidia computers were operating inside Blue. &#34;The BDX droids are just the beginning. We&#39;re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn&#39;t seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, Nvidia, and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,&#34; Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president at Disney Imagineering Research &amp; Development, said in a press release. During the keynote speech, Huang also announced an open-sourced humanoid robot foundational model, Isaac GR00T N1. A press release said Isaac GR00T N1 is &#34;the first of a family of fully customizable models that Nvidia will pre-train and release to worldwide robotics developers.&#34; Once the realm of science fiction , the hype is building around robots as AI accelerates their advancement. Nvidia is one of the leaders in the industry, which is largely powered by its AI computing chips. Huang told reporters at the GTC conference that he expects humanoids to replace factory workers in just a few years rather than decades. &#34;This is not a five-years-away problem,&#34; Huang said. Huang ended his keynote address with a nod to Disney&#39;s droid. &#34;Okay, Blue. Let&#39;s go home,&#34; Huang said. &#34;Good job.&#34; Representatives for Google did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-co-ceo-says-max-should-have-been-hbo-2025-3",
    "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he thinks &#34;Max&#34; should&#39;ve been called &#34;HBO.&#34; Natasha Campos via Getty Images Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, said &#34;Max&#34; should have been called &#34;HBO.&#34; In an interview with Variety, he said the brand asked consumers to focus on the wrong thing. He added that he doesn&#39;t see Amazon Prime as competition, and he doesn&#39;t &#34;understand&#34; Apple TV. Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, once saw HBO as the &#34; gold standard of original programming&#34; &mdash; but he thinks parent company Warner Bros. Discovery made a mistake when renaming its streaming service. &#34;It was a surprise! We would always watch what HBO was doing, and at one point, they had HBO, HBO Go, HBO Now, and HBO Max,&#34; Sarandos said in an&nbsp; interview &nbsp;with Variety. &#34;And I said, &#39;When they&#39;re serious, all those names will go away, and it&#39;ll just be HBO.&#39;&#34; &#34;HBO Max&#34; became just &#34;Max&#34; after the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery in 2021. &#34;This new brand signals an important change from two narrower products, HBO Max and Discovery+, to our broader content offering and consumer proposition,&#34; JB Perrette, CEO of Global Streaming &amp; Games for Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a 2023 press release. &#34;While each product offered something for some people, Max will have a broad array of quality choices for everybody,&#34; he added. In the process, according to Sarandos, the streaming service drew consumer focus to the wrong aspect of the brand. &#34;I would have never guessed HBO would have gone away,&#34; he said. &#34;They put all that effort into one thing that they can tell the consumer &mdash; it should be HBO.&#34; The proliferation of individual streaming services has ramped up heavily in recent years, including Amazon Prime, Max, and Apple TV. Regardless, Sarandos doesn&#39;t feel threatened. &#34;I felt a lot more comfortable that we would do better at this than they would,&#34; Sarandos said when asked whether he was worried when some of Netflix&#39;s suppliers, like Disney, suddenly became rivals. In a letter to shareholders in January 2025 , the company&nbsp; reported &nbsp;surpassing 300 million subscribers. &#34;Our advantage is the investment we&#39;ve made in personalization,&#34; he added. &#34;We are not a one-genre label.&#34; Sarandos also doesn&#39;t see Amazon Prime as capable of competing with Netflix in terms of movie and TV production, but he qualified that it is difficult for him to predict whether the company could pose a threat in the future without an awareness of their &#34;long-term plans.&#34; As for Apple, which has recently seen increased viewership of Apple TV+ thanks to marquee original programming like &#34; Severance ,&#34; Sarandos doesn&#39;t understand why the company invested in a streaming arm at all. &#34;I don&#39;t understand it beyond a marketing play, but they&#39;re really smart people,&#34; he said. &#34;Maybe they see something we don&#39;t.&#34; Above all else, Sarandos believes that Netflix&#39;s massive content library will continue to distinguish them from other players in the game. &#34;If you love documentary, Netflix is the doc house,&#34; he said. &#34;If you love drama, it&#39;s the drama house. As long as we have the ability to do that, we&#39;re going to be fine.&#34; Amazon, Warner Brothers Discovery, Netflix, and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider prior to publication.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-jets-destroy-houthi-drones-rockets-cheaper-than-top-missiles-2025-3",
    "description": "A Houthi drone is seen (left) before it is shot down. Screengrab via US Central Command video The US military published new footage showing its aircraft using rockets to destroy Houthi drones. The footage underscores how US fighter jets can use munitions that are cheaper than air-to-air missiles. The air-to-air engagement comes amid a new chapter in the Red Sea conflict. The US military published a video on Wednesday offering a rare look at an air-to-air kill from the Red Sea fight. It shows American fighter aircraft eliminating Houthi drones with cheap, guided rockets costing only a fraction of the price of top air-to-air missiles. The hit highlights a cost-effective way for American jets to take down Houthi drones , which have been a persistent threat, along with missiles, for well over a year now. US Central Command, which oversees Middle East operations , said Wednesday that a US fighter aircraft shot down a Houthi one-way attack drone using APKWS laser-guided rockets. The footage shows two drones exploding above the water. The AGR-20 FALCO Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System, or APKWS, are unguided Hydra 70 2.75-inch rockets equipped with laser guidance kits to turn them into precision weapons. The rockets are nearly 19 inches long and less than 3 inches in diameter, making them quite slim. Gen. David Allvin, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said the APKWS costs just $35,000 a piece &mdash; a fraction of one of the air-to-air missiles that could have been used instead to take down the drone. For instance, he said, the AIM-9 missile costs around $500,000, while the AIM-120 is more than double that at around $1 million. An F-16 is seen armed with an APKWS rocket. US Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. John Raven The cost of the rockets is more closely aligned with the price tag of a Houthi drone, which is likely in the range of tens of thousands of dollars. Officials have said that using an expensive missile to intercept this kind of threat is on the wrong side of the cost curve. &#34;More savings. More lethality. More Air Force,&#34; Allvin wrote on social media on Wednesday. CENTCOM did not disclose when or where the engagement occurred, nor did it say what aircraft used the APKWS to shoot down the Houthi drones. These rockets can be fired from a range of aircraft. A US official told The War Zone earlier this year that US Air Force F-16s had used the rockets against Houthi drones. Years earlier, the Air Force tested the air-to-ground rockets as a cheaper air-to-air kill solution. The footage comes amid a fresh campaign of US airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen. The Trump administration has vowed to intensify its efforts to deter the rebel group from attacking military and civilian vessels transiting key Middle East shipping lanes. The new campaign began on Saturday, with CENTCOM saying that it had &#34;initiated a series of operations consisting of precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen to defend American interests, deter enemies, and restore freedom of navigation.&#34; CENTCOM operations against Iran-backed Houthis continue... pic.twitter.com/DYvc3gREN8 &mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) March 15, 2025 Air Force Lt. Gen Alexus Grynkewich, the director of operations for the Joint Staff, said Monday that the initial wave of strikes hit over 30 Houthi targets at multiple locations in Yemen, including training sites, drone infrastructure, weapons storage facilities, and command centers. Grynkewich told reporters at a briefing that the operation extended into Sunday and Monday and would continue for several days &#34;until we achieve the president&#39;s objectives.&#34; CENTCOM has published footage this week showing flight operations aboard the USS Harry S. Truman &mdash; the latest US aircraft carrier to see combat against the Houthis &mdash; as well as missile launches from warships in its strike group. And President Donald Trump has suddenly taken an aggressive approach to the Houthi conflict after a period of relative quiet in the Red Sea. He has vowed to keep striking the rebels and even threatened to go after Iran, their main supporter and provider of military assistance. &#34;Tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians, and watch how it will get progressively worse &mdash; It&#39;s not even a fair fight, and never will be. They will be completely annihilated!&#34; Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "A Ukrainian soldier fires a mortar round during training in the Donetsk region on March 10. Photo by Roman Chop/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images President Trump and Vladimir Putin agreed Tuesday to set in motion a partial cease-fire. Ukraine&#39;s Zelenskyy appeared to agree on Wednesday to a reduction in attacks on energy facilities. But there are still serious &mdash; and difficult &mdash; questions ahead to end Russia&#39;s war on Ukraine. The US and Russia met to talk about a cease-fire deal . Russia&#39;s not ready to take that step yet, but Kyiv and Moscow have found something they can agree on: not blowing up each other&#39;s energy infrastructure. President Donald Trump spoke on Tuesday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The two leaders agreed on a preliminary reduction in missile and drone attacks on Ukraine&#39;s energy and infrastructure, setting the stage for follow-on negotiations, according to a White House readout of the call. That does not end Russia&#39;s effort to seize more land from Ukraine, which is happening amid a reduction in US arms support. &#34;The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,&#34; the US readout said. &#34;These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.&#34; The readout lays out a framework for further talks to end the war, but it was unclear whether Ukraine will be part of those direct negotiations and whether the Russian leader is actually willing to end the war. Trump followed up his call with Putin by speaking on Wednesday with Zelenskyy. Per a White House readout of that call, the two leaders agreed to stop attacking each other&#39;s energy facilities. Washington said teams will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss expanding the cease-fire to the Black Sea and then later to a full cease-fire. Trump and Zelenskyy &#34;agreed this could be the first step toward the full end of the war and ensuring security.&#34; A Ukrainian soldier walks through a tunnel in Pokrovsk, the site of heavy battles with Russian troops, in the Donetsk region on March 13. Iryna Rybakova/Ukraine&#39;s 93rd Mechanized Brigade via AP It has been a hard road, and there are tough questions hanging over the Trump administration&#39;s efforts to end the bloodshed in this three-year war that Russia launched to dominate Ukraine at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives and devastated cities and towns. Some of the looming questions are whether a cease-fire deal, as Trump has sought, is achievable and will hold, how Kyiv&#39;s security can be guaranteed, and what will deter Russia from invading again. On some of these issues, the history is far from reassuring. Ukraine will almost certainly need to maintain a large standing force and a wartime defense industry, with Western arms backing, to defend itself if the front lines are frozen . An added element would be an international peacekeeping force of 30,000 that still may not be enough to slow a renewed Russian offensive. Right now, Russia is demanding a militarily weakened Ukraine devoid of Western military support as a requirement for peace talks. Can Russia be trusted? The biggest challenge with a cease-fire deal if it comes together could be getting it to actually hold. Russia has violated previous agreements with Ukraine since the invasion first began in 2014, not to mention earlier ones. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced these concerns during last month&#39;s Oval Office meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance when the Ukrainian leader pointed to the fact that Putin broke a cease-fire deal with Kyiv in 2019. The Ukrainian president was then accused of not wanting peace. Kyiv has long feared that a cease-fire would be a respite for the bruised Russian army, a breather before it takes another swing. Russia, which has the battlefield initiative and is closing the Kursk salient while pressing forward inside Ukraine, has signaled it is unwilling to give the Ukrainians a chance to rest. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brought up Russian violations in a contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Defense experts at the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a January analysis of efforts to end this war that &#34;Ukraine will need to determine how to deter Russia from using any period of calm as an opportunity to rearm, wait for the world to lower its collective guard, and then attack again.&#34; Trump has said that he trusts Putin . The same can&#39;t be said for Zelenskyy. The distrust between Kyiv and Moscow could be trouble in negotiations. Mark Cancian, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Ukraine&#39;s &#34;stumbling block&#34; will be security guarantees. He told BI that Russia would also need to step back from maximum demands regarding Ukrainian sovereignty, territory, and disarmament to get to a cessation of hostilities. It is very possible that a cease-fire without strong arms support to Ukraine and a reduction in Russian demands fails to end, or even substantially pause, the war. The US has significant leverage over Ukraine because of its heavy arms support, but excluding Ukraine from direct talks with Russia may lead to a flawed cease-fire framework. Can Ukraine&#39;s security be guaranteed? Following Tuesday&#39;s talks, the Russian leader said that he wants Western countries to halt efforts to arm Ukraine as a condition to end the war, according to Russian state media. This particular demand raises questions about Ukraine&#39;s security during the cease-fire process. A rescue worker puts out a fire on a house after it was hit by a Russian drone in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on March 1. AP Photo/Kateryna Klochko Kyiv has repeatedly asked NATO for considerable security guarantees as part of a cease-fire deal with Russia. Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe and defends a 600-mile frontline through its land from the Black Sea to its northern border with Russia. While the UK and France have both indicated they are willing to send forces to Ukraine as part of a multinational security presence to ensure that Russia doesn&#39;t violate a cease-fire, Moscow has said it will not accept NATO countries participating in such plans. Even if it warms to the idea, it&#39;s a delicate and tricky situation. Ben Barry, a senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an analysis that a multinational force would demand structure, including an overarching strategy, unambiguous rules of engagement, and a very clear mission statement, among all the various other political and military considerations. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last month that any security guarantees must come from European and non-European militaries and not be deployed as part of a NATO mission. He said&nbsp; the US would not send troops to Ukraine. However, Vance said just days later that the US could send troops to Ukraine if Russia doesn&#39;t negotiate in good faith. Michael Waltz, Trump&#39;s national security advisor, said over the weekend that Ukraine might have to concede territory to Russia in exchange for security guarantees; Russia still occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory in the east and south. What these guarantees might ultimately be remains uncertain. Ukrainian soldiers prepare a drone for flight during a combat mission on March 12 in the Donetsk region.

Russia then invaded the country exactly two decades later. If Ukraine can&#39;t get Western forces to help ensure its security, history paints a bleak picture of potential outcomes. The Korean War is a frozen conflict, one in which aggression is deterred by around 30,000 US troops and the American nuclear umbrella. The grim alternatives when a country&#39;s security isn&#39;t guaranteed can be seen in the collapse of South Vietnam and Afghanistan . Experts say that Ukraine needs to bolster its defenses to be self-sufficient, regardless of security guarantees. In their CFR analysis, Paul Stares and Michael O&#39;Hanlon argued that any strategy should focus on strengthening Ukraine&#39;s military with strong deterrence abilities. They argued that post-war force planning should start now. Stares and O&#39;Hanlon said that Ukraine needs a multilayered territorial defense system for the territory it still controls.

Oleg Petrasiuk/Ukraine&#39;s 24th Mechanized Brigade via AP &#34;This step,&#34; they wrote, &#34;would comprise a hardened outer defense perimeter, a strategic rapid-response force to respond to serious threats, and enhanced protection for major population centers and critical infrastructure.&#34; They called for an active-duty force of 500,000 and nearly the same in ready reserve. To deter Russian military power, Ukraine will need to further fortify its long lines with Russia and rebuild its arsenal with an aim that should Russian forces attack, they will be slowed by a defense-in-depth strategy, buying time for Ukraine to counter-attack. Layered defenses have proven effective and contributed to the war&#39;s largely static lines. An international peacekeeping force could serve as conflict monitors. They could also have orders to assist Ukraine in fighting off a renewed Russian attack, a contribution that may be especially useful if they have air forces with stand-off weapons that can airstrike Russian assault columns. Can Russia be deterred? Ukrainian and European officials have said that hard military power and smart decision-making are needed to deter potential future Russian aggression. The European parliament said last week that Ukraine &#34;must be empowered to reject hasty deals that weaken its security in the mid- and long-term and risk subjecting it and other European countries to renewed Russian aggression in the future.&#34; A belligerent Russia poses a threat beyond Ukraine. It has one of the world&#39;s largest arms industries and is mass-producing the firepower needed to advance on modern battlefields. Analysts worry it may only need a few years to regroup to re-attack Ukraine or seek conquest elsewhere. Russian soldiers patrol an area in Sudzha, in the Kursk region, in this photo taken from a video distributed on March 13. Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP Parallel to the Ukraine war, there have been consistent concerns about increasing Russian aggression on NATO soil , especially amid questions of US support for the alliance under the Trump administration. These developments have pushed European countries to rearm and strengthen their militaries to deter Moscow. &#34;In Europe, the long-term risk is a renewal of conflict after Russia has been able to rebuild its military forces,&#34; said Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel. &#34;In the Pacific, the risk is that China will see this partial Putin victory as an encouraging precedent for taking over Taiwan.&#34; Russia could choose to go after Ukraine again. It could choose another target. Ukraine isn&#39;t the first European country it&#39;s invaded. How this war eventually ends will shape Moscow&#39;s thinking, either deterring or emboldening it.

    "title": "Wait a minute. Has Elon Musk really turned Twitter around, after all?",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-x-twitter-value-advertising-2025-3",
    "description": "Elon Musk scared away many of his advertisers after he bought Twitter in 2022, and the company&#39;s value plummeted. Now it has reportedly recovered. Samuel Corum/Getty Images Elon Musk bought Twitter/X for $44 billion in 2022, and immediately saw his advertisers and advertising money disappear. Twitter&#39;s value plunged, accordingly. Now it seems to have recovered. Without real access to Twitter&#39;s financials, it&#39;s hard to assess what&#39;s really happening. But it&#39;s possible that investors don&#39;t care &mdash; they just want to be in the Elon Musk business. After Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022 &mdash; after spending months trying not to buy Twitter &mdash; the world&#39;s richest man said he&#39;d overpaid for the company . Then Musk drove down the value of his asset even more, by scaring off advertisers and users. Some investors who&#39;d helped Musk finance the deal eventually marked down the value of Twitter &mdash; which he&#39;s since renamed X &mdash; by nearly 70%. But now investors are reportedly saying that Twitter/X is worth $44 billion , after all. One of those investors may be Elon Musk himself . So what happened? Did Musk really turn Twitter around? That&#39;s an open debate, and part of it depends on where you stand on the political spectrum. Here are some things we know: Though lots of high-profile people have left Twitter, plenty of high-profile people still use Twitter. And though Bluesky and Meta&#39;s Threads and even Donald Trump&#39;s Truth Social have been positioned as Twitter rivals, they don&#39;t seem to have anything like the cultural and political relevancy that Twitter still has. Meanwhile, while Musk&#39;s alliance with Donald Trump has had some downsides for his company &mdash; ask Tesla shareholders &mdash; there&#39;s still a sense that his direct connection to the White House means his portfolio companies will benefit from Trump 2.0. There are lots of stories about advertisers returning to Twitter &mdash; either because they think the US political shift means it makes sense to be there, or, as my colleague Lara O&#39;Reilly has reported, because they want to avoid legal and political headaches . But I am a frequent Twitter user and I have yet to see any sign of Big Brand Ads returning to my timeline. Which suggests to me that brands who are returning aren&#39;t really doing it with gusto &mdash; instead, they&#39;re &#34;playing defense,&#34; as an ad executive told Lara. Those observations don&#39;t seem like a reason to boost Twitter back to the price Musk paid for it in 2022. Which, again, was considerably higher than public market investors thought Twitter was worth to begin with. But that&#39;s a vibes-based analysis. What about about the financials? Here, we don&#39;t have a lot to go on other than reporting from Bloomberg and the Financial Times, whose journalists have either seen or heard the pitch Twitter boosters have been making to investors in recent weeks. They report, citing people familiar with the matter, that while Twitter&#39;s revenue is still way down from where it was pre-Musk, the company had an &#34;adjusted&#34; EBITDA of $1.2 billion in 2024 &mdash; in the ballpark of what Twitter was doing pre-Musk. That sounds pretty good! If you&#39;re an investor in an advertising-based company, you&#39;d be concerned about all of that advertising money evaporating. But you&#39;d be encouraged by the fact that Musk seems to be making as much on the bottom line as old Twitter. It implies a lot of upside if advertising really does come back. Except… we don&#39;t really know what that $1.2 billion &#34;adjusted EBITDA&#34; number really means. An unnamed source with knowledge of X&#39;s finances tells the FT the number is &#34;wildly adjusted&#34; but doesn&#39;t elaborate; Bloomberg said the figure includes &#34;a significant list of adjustments that help boost the numbers.&#34; Those seem like very important caveats. And without knowing what they actually are, you can&#39;t really assess how Twitter is actually doing. A Twitter rep declined to comment on the company&#39;s financials. But we do have one more data point that helps explain why investors are willing to act as if Twitter has turned around, regardless of its P&amp;L: Twitter owns a $6 billion stake in xAI , Musk&#39;s artificial intelligence company that relies in part on data generated by Musk&#39;s Twitter/X. And investors are very excited about that company, because investors are excited about AI. So if you can own part of one Elon Musk company that may or may not be on the turnaround, but it comes with part of another Elon Musk company that could be red-hot, then… maybe you do it? To be sure: A stake in a privately held AI company could be worth a lot more, one day, when the AI race shakes out. Or it could be worth much less. Along the same lines: Over the past decade or so we&#39;ve seen lots of supposedly hot private tech companies get a rude reality check when public investors get a chance to assess their prospects and decide they&#39;re worth much less than their private backers thought. And the flip side of that is that people who put money into Tesla or SpaceX years ago are very, very happy with their decision. And as I noted last summer when Twitter appeared to be at its financial nadir, lots of the people associated with Musk&#39;s Twitter deal don&#39;t really care what happens to Twitter. They simply want to be in business with Elon Musk so they can continue to be in business with Elon Musk. And as long as that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s going to be very, very hard to understand what Twitter is truly worth. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/are-brion-shante-temptation-island-still-together-what-happened-2025-3",
    "description": "Brion and Shanté appeared on &#34;Temptation Island&#34; a year into their relationship. Tyler Golden / Netflix Brion and Shanté are one of the most controversial couples on Netflix&#39;s first season of &#34;Temptation Island.&#34; Brion cheats on Shanté by having a threesome with two other women on the show. They are still dating a year later. Warning: Major spoilers ahead for &#34;Temptation Island&#34; season one. On Netflix&#39;s &#34; Temptation Island ,&#34; Brion fails the commitment test his girlfriend sets him by having a threesome, but they are still together. Brion, a 26-year-old financial advisor, and Shanté, a 29-year-old account executive, are one of the four main couples on Netflix&#39;s first season of &#34;Temptation Island.&#34; The series first premiered on Fox in 2001. But after a reboot on USA in 2019, which lasted five seasons, Netflix acquired the rights and added &#34;Temptation Island&#34; to its growing slate of dating shows . In the series, couples are separated and put in a house full of singles eager to test if they will cheat. In the first episode, Brion says he met Shanté through a mutual friend at his church and they have dated for a year. They say they want to take part in the experiment to affirm their commitment to one another. &#34;I&#39;m just at the point now where I want to show her that I can stop being so flirtatious,&#34; Brion says. &#34;I think I&#39;m just ready to take our relationship serious.&#34; Brion says he broke up with Shanté early on in the relationship to be with another woman, but returned after realizing that &#34;the grass isn&#39;t greener.&#34; Shanté says that Brion is a &#34;really sexual person&#34; and has asked her to work on &#34;being more sexual towards him.&#34; Brion cheats on Shanté, but she takes him back Brion checks for cameras before entering a bathroom with Courtney and Alex in &#34;Temptation Island&#34; season one, episode five. Courtesy of Netflix While the women in relationships on &#34;Temptation Island&#34; initially don&#39;t show any interest in the single men, the men flirt with the single women once they are separated from their partners. Brion bonds with four women &mdash; Amiah, Courtney, Angel, and Alex. He complains to them that he wants a threesome and to be sexually adventurous, but his girlfriend isn&#39;t interested. In episode four, Alex and Brion enter his bathroom together and close the door. There is no camera angle to show what happens in the room, making him look suspicious. In episode five, Courtney and Alex ask Brion if he would like to have a threesome, and they make some telling noises in the bathroom and leave naked the next morning. After the threesome with Alex and Courtney, Brion stops interacting with them and votes them off the show. Courtesy of Netflix Every few episodes, the original couples congregate at separate bonfires for the men and women to be shown brief clips of what their partners have been doing. Shanté is upset and shocked by Brion&#39;s behavior, and he feels a little remorseful when he sees that he made her cry. But Brion believes she will take him back and decides to be more faithful for the remainder of the series. When the couple reunite at the end of the series, Shanté criticizes Brion for cheating and saying he doesn&#39;t regret the threesome. Brion tears up, apologizes, and says he&#39;s a changed man. Shanté says she wants to put herself first and initially seems to be breaking up with him, but after a long conversation, she takes him back because she believes he&#39;s matured. Brion and Shanté are still together after &#39;Temptation Island&#39; Shanté agrees to continue her relationship with Brion in the &#34;Temptation Island&#34; finale. Courtesy of Netflix Brion and Shanté told Netflix&#39;s Tudum that they spoke about the entire experience after leaving the show, which gave them closure. Shanté said she wished Brion did not need to have the threesome to realize what he wanted, but she thinks it helped them have tough conversations and get closer. Brion said, &#34;I regret what I did, but I know it needed to happen, because grew up a lot.&#34; They said they are planning to move in together once Brion&#39;s current lease is up and hope to marry and have kids in the future. On Wednesday, Brion also shared an Instagram post of pictures and videos of the couple over the last year. &#34;We&#39;re not perfect, but we&#39;re real. We&#39;ll keep growing, laughing, and building together,&#34; Brion wrote in the caption. Shanté reshared the post on her Instagram story. Season one of Netflix&#39;s &#34;Temptation Island&#34; is available to stream. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/powell-trump-tariffs-adding-to-inflation-interest-rates-trade-policy-2025-3",
    "description": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell discussed the impact of Trump&#39;s tariffs on the economy. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation is unlikely to make further progress this year due in part to Trump&#39;s tariffs. He added that the Fed&#39;s inflation forecast is rising primarily due to uncertainty with Trump&#39;s policies. Powell&#39;s comments followed the Fed&#39;s decision to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday. The head of the nation&#39;s central bank said President Donald Trump&#39;s trade policies are set to delay further progress on bringing inflation down. After the Federal Open Market Committee announced on Wednesday that it is holding interest rates steady for the second time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters during a press conference that Trump&#39;s tariff plans present significant uncertainty for the economy going forward. When asked about the FOMC&#39;s economic projections for the rest of the year &mdash; which showed higher inflation than the previous forecast in December &mdash; Powell said that &#34;a good part of it is coming from tariffs.&#34; &#34;I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed,&#34; Powell said. He added that the FOMC&#39;s Summary of Economic Projections &#34;doesn&#39;t really show further downward progress on inflation this year, and that&#39;s really due to the tariffs coming in.&#34; !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}}))}(); The latest consumer price index data found that inflation increased 2.8% year-over-year in February, inching toward the Fed&#39;s 2% inflation target. Since taking office, Trump has proposed and implemented a range of tariff policies. He most recently put a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports into effect, and he&#39;s delayed other tariff announcements on goods from key trading partners, including Canada and Mexico. Trump has previously acknowledged that Americans would feel &#34;some pain&#34; as a result of his trade policies but has overall maintained that his plans would benefit Americans in the long run. Powell said during his press conference that tariffs &#34;tend to bring growth down, they tend to bring inflation up.&#34; The median FOMC member still projected two interest-rate cuts for 2025, unchanged from its projections in December. Powell noted that economic uncertainty, largely caused by Trump&#39;s tariff plans, could very well change those forecasts. Powell acknowledged the poor consumer sentiment among Americans , particularly regarding high grocery prices, saying that it &#34;probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that&#39;s making big changes in policy.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "I left the US to move to Eastern Europe with my new husband. It helped me better understand the beauty of American culture.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-abroad-eastern-europe-changed-view-american-culture-2025-3",
    "description": "The author, not pictured, found a new appreciation for the US while living abroad. Dmytro Betsenko/Getty Images I moved from the US to Kosovo with my husband after years of fantasizing about living abroad. I love Eastern Europe&#39;s sense of community and culture. But I eventually realized the country I left behind has its own beauty, too, in its diversity. Three years ago, I boarded a plane and flew across the Atlantic Ocean , taking all my worldly goods in only three suitcases. I had sold or given away everything else. I had decided to move to Europe with my new husband. We settled down in Kosovo, where he was born and raised. But that meant I had to leave my birthplace, the US. I was nervous but excited. I had always dreamed of leaving the US and seeing the rest of the world. Everywhere else seemed so fascinating. But it took me leaving the US and settling in Eastern Europe to see the beauty of my home country. Moving far away was a lifelong dream Since I was young, I have wanted to travel outside America . I remember going for a walk in the small Wisconsin village where I grew up and fantasizing about being in France, England, or even India. I dreamed of other cultures: the bright lights of Paris, the vivid colors of a Turkish bazaar , and the strong smell of spices from a street food vendor in Thailand. I had never done anything to fulfill that dream. Life got in the way: I got married, and then I was widowed. I had a life full of responsibilities that seemed so hard to change. I also never knew where to go. The world is so big, and many exciting places exist. How does one choose? Thankfully, fate brought me the answer and the opportunity When I met my second husband , the choice was made for me. He was an immigrant from Kosovo who opened a whole new world. When we first met, he served me tea in tiny glass cups with little spoons. It was charming. I fell in love with him and his culture. When we visited his birthplace, I fell in love with it, too. I knew in my heart that I wanted to move there. People were shocked &mdash; especially immigrants to the US that we knew from the region. They couldn&#39;t imagine going back. The pandemic pushed our departure date back by over a year, but I eventually left the US to start the life I always dreamed of abroad. I have since found the beauty in the country I left behind My experience living outside the US has been eye-opening. In my experience in Kosovo, community is more important than individuality. Families are close-knit, with multi-generational households being the norm. It is unthinkable not to know your neighbor. The pace is also slower. Life is lived and not rushed through. When I first arrived in Kosovo, I wished the US would adopt some of these values. But over time, I started to see the US in a new light. I started to miss the US&#39;s diversity . I was born in Milwaukee, where every summer, there are dozens of festivals to celebrate the city&#39;s different communities. It was always my favorite part of summer. The longer I&#39;ve lived in Eastern Europe, the more I&#39;ve thought about the power of the US ideals: liberty, freedom, and inclusion. They make my home country special, and I hold onto them even though I&#39;m still an ocean away. While I didn&#39;t experience a strong sense of community in the US, there&#39;s still a power to living alongside people who are nothing like you. While I dreamed of leaving the US for most of my life, it took my leaving my birthplace to really understand the beauty of it. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "At a Greek resort surrounded by 131 infinity pools, six waterslides and a golf course designed by Bernhard Langer, Sebastian Coe is taking aim at a fourth Olympic triumph – but his path to victory is narrow One question, more than any other, swirled around the exclusive Costa Navarino resort on Wednesday evening. Could Sebastian Coe really pull it out of the fire again? At the Moscow and Los Angeles Olympics he bounced back from defeat in the 800m to take 1500m gold. Then, against the odds in Singapore in 2005, he brought the 2012 Games to London ahead of Paris and Madrid. And now, in the final hours before Thursday’s vote for the next International Olympic Committee president, he was busy pressing flesh and securing promises in the hope of a fourth Olympic win.

Robinson, who Donald Trump last month described as helping “drive our country forward to greatness”, is widely considered a national hero in the US. He broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier in 1947 when he suited up for the Brooklyn Dodgers; he went on to be elected to his sport’s Hall of Fame. Robinson also served in the US Army during the second world war.

    "description": "The Duke freshman has all the tools to flourish as a professional. But the potential to earn money in college means staying amateur has upsides Late in the first half of Duke’s recent game against Georgia Tech, Blue Devils star Cooper Flagg suffered an ankle sprain so gruesome that he had to be helped off the court in a wheelchair. Five years ago, losing college basketball’s biggest draw to a heart-stopping injury on the eve of the NCAA Tournament would have had Duke fans death-spiraling along with the game’s corporate stakeholders. So why do those fans seem so relieved? For one thing, it looks as if the freshman will be fit for Duke’s first-round game on Friday. For another, he could be at Duke for a while yet: a scary injury is no longer a spur for talented college players to turn professional and make money while they still can. That all changed in July 2021, when the NCAA allowed college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness (NIL), and make money while they’re still students. By letting go of one of its foundational tenets (the notion that “amateurs” should not be paid), the NCAA now has its member schools scrambling to build sponsorship war chests to lure top talent. The athletes, for so long the biggest losers in the NCAA’s billion-dollar amateur system, are finally making gains, meaning they are less inclined to turn professional as soon as possible.

    "description": "Forget the days of Wenger and Houllier – there is a worrying lack of French coaches in Europe’s elite leagues these days Where have all the coaches gone? French sports media address the theme on a regular basis and with good reason: the country’s football managers are no longer wanted abroad. The days when Arsène Wenger and Gérard Houllier opened the door for Jean Tigana, Rémi Garde, Claude Puel and others to coach in England are long gone. In the 2000s and 2010s, French managers could also find work in La Liga and Serie A, as Philippe Montanier did at Real Sociedad and Rudi Garcia at Roma and Napoli – leaving aside Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps, who could not be really considered expatriates at Real Madrid and Juventus. This is no longer the case and takes particular significance now that Deschamps, whose France side face Croatia in a Nations League quarter-final on Thursday and Sunday, has entered the final straight of his 14-year association with Les Bleus and confirmed he will leave his position at the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup.

The league’s board, comprising owners in the two professional men’s circuits (the second-division USL Championship and the third-division USL League One) voted to enact promotion and relegation within the USL ecosystem. If it comes to fruition, it will be the first time promotion and relegation will exist in the modern history of US soccer.

    "description": "The 163-page PTPA lawsuit contains some valid and not so valid criticism of the professional tours and major events The Professional Tennis Players’ Association came into existence on the eve of the 2020 US Open and at the height of pandemic restrictions. After an inauspicious start, the association co-founded by Novak&nbsp;Djokovic has spent time building its professional structures, finances and player support while trying to gain influence in the sport. The&nbsp;PTPA functions ostensibly as a players’ union but it is not legally recognised as such, since players are classed as independent contractors rather&nbsp;than employees. As the PTPA’s numerous attempts to gain a seat at tennis’s decision-making table have been&nbsp;rebuffed, often vigorously, by the leading governing bodies – the Association of Tennis Professionals, the Women’s Tennis Association, the International Tennis Federation and the four grand&nbsp;slam tournaments – it became increasingly likely that their acrimonious relations would lead&nbsp;to litigation. The PTPA’s decision to initiate on Tuesday a lawsuit against the ATP, WTA and ITF, while naming the grand slam events as co-conspirators, marks a dramatic intensification of its campaign for players’ rights. It also comes as no great surprise. Continue reading...",
