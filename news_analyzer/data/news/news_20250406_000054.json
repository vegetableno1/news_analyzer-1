    "description": "萨姆·卡布拉尔（Sam Cabral） BBC新闻，华盛顿 15 分钟前 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz） 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz）起初是卡马拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）的潜在副手人选中名不见经传的一位。但随着他在电视节目上的一句“这些人就是怪”走红，他一跃成为民主党副总统候选人。 现年60岁的蒂姆·沃尔兹以接地气、坦率和犀利回应共和党反对派发起的进攻。 他还拥有一份引人注目的履历——在从政前，他曾担任过公立学校教师、美式橄榄球教练和国民警卫队队员。 他曾在国会代表一个倾向共和党的选区，后来又在明尼苏达州州长任上通过了左翼政策。在美国政治两极分化的今天，他的从政经历可能具有广泛的吸引力。 教师、教练和议员 沃尔兹出生于内布拉斯加州乡村，曾在夏天务农和打猎，17岁时加入美国陆军国民警卫队。他在这支志愿部队服役长达24年。 沃尔兹的父亲是一名公立学校行政人员，曾鼓励他参军。19岁时，他的父亲因肺癌去世。 这位明尼苏达州州长曾谈到他的母亲靠社会保障遗属津贴维生，而《美国军人权利法案》帮其支付了大学学费。 凭借教师学位，沃尔兹在1989年“六四”天安门镇压事件发生前后，赴中国担任了一年教师。 后来，他与妻子格温·惠普尔（Gwen Whipple）前往中国度蜜月，还组织美国学生暑期到中国游学。 回到内布拉斯加州家乡后，沃尔兹当上了老师和美式橄榄球教练，直到他的妻子（学校另一名教师）带他回到了明尼苏达州的家乡。他们现在育有两个孩子。 作为曼卡托西高中（Mankato West High School）的教练，沃尔兹帮助学校建立了美式橄榄球项目，并带领学校首次获得州冠军。 他还因同意担任学校同志与非同志联盟的指导老师而赢得赞誉，当时同性恋在很大程度上受到人们的排斥。 他最初在明尼苏达州南部一个以农业为主的地区竞选公职，这个地区非常乡村，倾向于共和党。 但沃尔兹因在竞选中表现得温和及关注公共服务和退伍军人权益而爆冷。 图像来源， Getty Images 2007 年众议院伊拉克投票后，蒂姆·沃尔兹和南希·佩洛西等一众的留影。 观点和信仰 在沃尔兹12年的国会生涯中，很难给他的意识形态贴上标签。 他投票支持《平价医疗法案》，共同发起了包括提高最低工资法案在内的有利于劳工的措施，并支持一项未获成功的减少碳排放的限额交易措施。 但他也找到了与共和党人的共同点。 他投票支持继续为伊拉克和阿富汗战争提供资金，支持对进入美国的难民进行更严格审查，并试图阻止奥巴马时代在2008年金融危机后对银行和汽车公司的救助。 支持拥枪权的全国步枪协会曾为他的竞选活动捐款。但在2018年佛罗里达帕克兰校园枪击案发生后，他公开表示支持禁止攻击性武器，因此失去了该协会的支持。 2018年，沃尔兹在明尼苏达州州长竞选中以超过11个百分点的优势胜出，但他的首个任期因新冠疫情和明尼阿波利斯警察杀害乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）事件而蒙上阴影。 共和党人严厉批评沃尔兹在抗议活动愈演愈烈时，仍迟迟没有部署国民警卫队。 但这名州长赢得了连任。在民主党以一个席位的优势控制着州议会的情况下，他的第二个任期相当忙碌。 该州民主党人将堕胎权奉为圭臬、制定了带薪事假和病假、加强了枪支法、为学校普及免费膳食提供资金，并对经济适用房进行投资。 这一系列紧锣密鼓的活动引起了前总统贝拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）的注意，他写道： “ 如果你需要一个实例证明选举是会产生影响的，看看明尼苏达州正在发生什么。” 图像来源， Getty Images 蒂姆·沃尔兹在从政之前是一名公立学校教师、橄榄球教练和国民警卫队成员。 “这些人都很怪” 沃尔兹在全国范围内知名度并不高，但最近几周，他对共和党人的尖刻描述迅速引起了热议。 “ 另一方都是怪人。 &quot;他最近在美国媒体MSNBC上说出这个频繁使用的标签。 “ 他们想要禁书。 他们想进入你（医生）的检查室。” 但共和党人很快就攻击他在明尼苏达州的所作所为，称其对普通美国人来说过于激进。 美国众议院排名第三的共和党人汤姆·埃默（Tom Emmer）指责沃尔兹试图 “ 把明尼苏达州变成卡马拉·哈里斯的家乡加利福尼亚州。” 但包括劳工领袖在内的盟友认为，沃尔兹可以扩大卡马拉·哈里斯对农村和工人阶级选民的吸引力。 众议院民主党人安吉·克雷格（Angie Craig）正在为连任展开激烈的竞争，她称赞沃尔兹是 “ 久经考验的领导者。” 她告诉BBC，沃尔兹是 “ 公认的赢家，在许多艰难的竞选中从未失败过”，她相信他将是卡马拉·哈里斯的最佳副手人选。",

    "description": "2024年7月29日 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了重要的圣经场景“最后的晚餐”。 巴黎奥运开幕至今，尺度较大的开幕式上若干细节成为遭到热议的话题，在各项赛事开始之后，赛场上也有争议现象出现。国际奥委会、巴黎奥组委甚至已对一些事件进行解释和道歉。 以下是BBC整理的本届奥运会截至目前的几大争议场面，以及其发酵讨论过程。 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 2024年巴黎奥运会有什么独特之处？ 奥组委为开幕式冒犯感“道歉” 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了文艺复兴时期著名画家达芬奇的名画“最后的晚餐”。 这幅名画描绘的是一个重要的圣经场景。 批评者之一法国天主教会（Catholic Church in France）表示，开幕式突出了“嘲弄、蔑视基督教的场景”。 图像来源， EPA 巴黎奥运开幕式上的表演包括演绎一场晚餐，以及模仿希腊神话酒神狄俄尼索斯，引发了批评。 美国电讯公司C Spire表示，在“被开幕式上对最后的晚餐进行的嘲弄震惊”后，正在撤下奥运会的周边广告。 意大利副总理萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）、美国众议院议长约翰逊（Mike Johnson）也提出批评，认为对《最后的晚餐》的嘲弄，令全球基督徒感到震惊及侮辱。 开幕式艺术总监若利（Thomas Jolly）表示，绝没有故意嘲弄或蔑视任何人，存在争议的场景是为了代表异教徒诸神。 “很明显，从来没有故意不尊重任何宗教群体的意图。”巴黎奥组委发言人德尚（Anne Descamps）周日（7月28日）对记者表示。 她说，“与之相反，我认为若利努力歌颂社区包容。我们相信这雄心壮志已经实现，若有任何人感到被冒犯，我们真的非常抱歉。” 若利也对法国媒体表示，“这个创意是为了展示一场和奥林匹斯众神有关的、盛大的多神的派对。” “在我的作品中你看不到嘲笑任何人的意图。我想要的是把人们团结在一起、调和各方的开幕式，同时展现自由、平等、博爱的法国大革命精神。” 错将韩国当朝鲜 国际奥委会道歉 图像来源， Reuters 在韩国代表团乘船参加开幕式时，法语及英语播报员介绍他们时都用的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”（Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea），毫无疑问这正是朝鲜（北韩）的官方名称。 这个名字稍后又被播报，不过这次用对了地方，介绍的是入场的朝鲜代表团。 南北朝鲜自从二战结束后分治，双方的紧张局势近日还有所升温。 不过，电视字幕上提供的名字是正确的。 韩国文化体育观光部随后表示，会就此过失向法国政府进行强烈抗议和投诉。该声明说，对于这一播报表示遗憾，因为韩国代表团被介绍为了朝鲜队。 该国文化体育观光部副部长张美兰（Jang Mi-ran）还要求就此事和国际奥委会主席巴赫进行会谈。 国际奥委会已经在其官方X（前推特）账号里称，“我们要就韩国代表团在开幕式上被错误介绍一事表示深深的道歉。” 前强奸犯参赛被嘘 图像来源， Getty Images 曾经犯下强奸儿童罪的荷兰沙滩排球运动员史蒂文·范德费尔德（Steven van de Velde）首次出现在奥运赛场，收获了掌声和嘘声。 2016年他因强奸一名12岁的英国女孩被判四年监禁。一年后获假释出狱，有犯罪纪录。 他和搭档目前世界排名第10，在埃菲尔铁塔体育场的首秀中败于一对意大利组合。他们将于31日出战下一场比赛。 范德费尔德在比赛前被介绍给观众时，赛场同时出现掌声和嘘声。 在首场比赛前，一份网络请愿呼吁禁止他参加奥运会，这份请愿书获得了9万签名。 有观众对BBC体育说出了自己的观点。 一位英国观众说，“他表现出了开放和诚实……但我个人觉得他们做出了一个艰难的决定。” 另一位英国观众说，“他们应该选择其他人，以避免引起争议。如果这是一个英国人，我可不愿让他出现在我们的队伍中。” 但一位荷兰观众说，范德费尔德参赛是对的，“他已经受到了惩罚，都结束了。他可以像其他人一样继续生活。” 范德费尔德此前接受荷兰媒体采访时说，“我无法改变（观众），因此我必须承受后果。这是我人生中的最大错误。” 国际奥委会表示，运动员的选择权在国家奥委会。 范德费尔德2017年重回赛场，荷兰奥委会说，他已经满足了荷兰排球联合会关于运动员犯罪后重返赛场的标准。",

    "description": "24 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎奥运会的金银铜牌 在巴黎奥运会的拳击和田径两个项目中，夺冠的运动员获得的不仅仅是奖牌。 1896年，现代奥运会在雅典拉开帷幕，当时这是一项严格意义上的业余赛事，既没有职业运动员，也不允许提供奖金。 然而，在今年夏天的巴黎，运动员中既有年收入数亿美元的超级富豪，也有艰难负担比赛费用的参赛者。 奥运选手的收入来源多种多样：赞助商、国家给予的经济奖励，以及本届首次在奥运会上发放的奖金。 由于并非每个项目都有奖金，这一决定引发了争议，即如何最好地分配奥运会带来的财富。 2024巴黎奥运奖牌榜 张家朗、江旻憓巴黎奥运夺金 拆解香港如何成为剑击之城 仅限拳击和田径 图像来源， Getty Images 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德 (Julien Alfred) 在赢得女子 100米冠军后将获得 50,000 美元奖金以及金牌。 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德（​Julien Alfred）在夺得女子100米冠军后，将获得5万美元奖金和金牌。 在2024年巴黎奥运会的32个体育项目中，只有田径和拳击两个项目可以获得奖金。 今年4月，国际田径管理机构世界田联（World Athletics）出人意料地宣布，2024年巴黎奥运会金牌得主将获得5万美元（3.94万英镑）的奖金。 一个月后，国际拳击协会（IBA）表示，该机构也将向奥运冠军发放10万美元（7.87万英镑）的奖金，不过其中四分之一将归运动员所在国的拳击协会所有，另外四分之一归教练所有。 在这两项运动中，银牌和铜牌获得者的奖金较少。而拳击比赛中，排名前五的选手都将获得奖励。 这些奖金并非直接来自奥运会主办方，而是来自这两个项目的管理机构。 世界田联正在使用从国际奥委会（IOC）获得的部分资金，这些资金是奥运会收入的一部分。而这笔钱以前被用于更广泛的运动员培养，有人质疑设立奖金是否是明智之举。 考文垂大学（Coventry University）社会商业中心的汤姆·巴森（Tom Bason）博士专门研究大型体育赛事。他说：“奖金流向获胜者，这或许强化了顶级运动员是有偿（竞技）的事实。” “在田径项目上夺金的人，很可能已经是那些拥有巨额赞助和代言合同的人了。” “其中一种批评声是，这笔钱可以更好地用于培养运动员，把钱花在年轻运动员身上，而不是那些在比赛中名列前茅的人。” 不过，考虑到一些奥运冠军曾陷入经济困境，他们亦能从额外的收入中受益。苏联体操传奇人物奥尔加·科尔布特（Olga Korbut）在其奥运生涯中获得了四枚金牌和两枚银牌。但在2017年，她不得不以33.35万美元的价格出售了自己的三枚奖牌。 拳击比赛奖金的来源则不太清楚。国际奥委会最近断绝了与国际拳击协会的一切联系，理由是后者的运作“缺乏财务透明度。” “与以往国际拳击协会的资金一样，这笔钱的来源尚不清楚。”国际奥委会在一份公开声明中说。 巴森博士补充说：“也许有人会说，国际拳击协会这样做是为了让自己成为奥运会的一部分，并与其保持密切联系。” 民族自豪感 图像来源， Getty Images 运动员在奥运会上获得奖牌后，还有很多其他方式可以获得经济奖励。 许多运动员会因为能登上领奖台，而获得所在国家的奖励。 新加坡被认为是在支付奖金方面最慷慨的地方之一，每位巴黎的金牌得主将获得75万美元的奖金。 东道主法国的奖金为8万欧元（8.7万美元），而摩洛哥运动员的奖金更高，为20万美元。 美国则更少，该国的“黄金行动”（Operation Gold）基金向运动员发放3.75万美元。 英国等国则完全不向奖牌得主提供经济奖励。 取而代之的是，英国国家队在奥运会前会向运动员提供一定数额的资助。被认定有很大机会夺金的选手每年最多可获得2.8万英镑。 虽然这些钱绝非小数目，但与世界上最著名的运动员所能赚取的巨额财富相比，还是相差甚远。 “（参加奥运会的）运动员中，既有像美国篮球队那样拿着高薪的球员，也有靠兼职工作养活自己的运动员。”巴森博士说。 明星的力量 图像来源， Getty Images NBA 巨星NBA 巨星勒布朗·詹姆斯是奥运会上收入最高的运动员之一。 根据《福布斯》发布的年度体育富豪榜，西班牙高尔夫名将乔恩·拉姆（Jon Rahm）是2024年巴黎奥运会收入最高的运动员。据这本财经杂志估计，拉姆去年的收入为2.18亿美元，其中大部分收入来自备受争议的由沙特资助的LIV高尔夫巡回赛。 意料之中的是，收入排名第二的是美国明星篮球运动员勒布朗·詹姆斯（Lebron James）。据信，他的收入为1.28亿美元。 由于高尔夫和篮球在国际上的影响力巨大，参加奥运会可能对拉姆和詹姆斯本已丰厚的收入影响不大。 但对于知名度较低的运动员来说，赢得奖牌可以帮助他们增加收入，这是他们所急需的。 他们通常会在代言合同中写入一项条款，规定如果他们登上领奖台，就可从赞助商那里获得奖金。 这些条款一般都是保密的，但2016年耐克（Nike）和新百伦（New Balance）的一场法律纠纷披露，如果美国长跑选手鲍里斯·贝里安（Boris Berian）在奥运会上夺金，将获得15万美元的奖金。 “我想很多人看到美国顶级运动员或为欧洲球队效力的国际足球运动员，就认为每名运动员都可以动辄每周挣10万、20万美元，但事实远非如此。”巴森博士说。 “有许多运动员都在为生计而挣扎。几年前，澳大利亚曾做过一项研究，他们发现目前在为2032年奥运会进行训练的运动员中，有40%的人都有一份兼职或全职工作。” 即使是在拥有许多世界上最富有的体育明星的美国，许多选手的生活也依然不易。​ 美国奥委会和残奥委会最近的一项研究发现，26.5%的现役运动员年收入低于1.5万美元。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 未来的变化 2024年巴黎奥运会颁发的每枚奖牌上，都有一小块取自埃菲尔铁塔的铁片。 向顶级运动员发放奖金是否是体育协会资金的最佳用途，这一激烈的辩论将继续，很可能会扩大到田径和拳击以外的领域。 “（各运动的）体育协会肯定会面临支付奖金的压力。”巴森博士说。 不过，这可能会给媒体曝光率较低的体育项目带来问题，从而导致资金短缺。 “田径和国际拳击是世界上最受瞩目的两项运动。&quot;巴森博士说。“这两项运动将更容易从赞助和代言中获得额外资金。” “而其他运动项目，比如皮划艇，如果它有支付运动员奖金的压力，可能就不那么容易了。” 2024年巴黎奥运会的冠军们至少可以安慰自己，他们将至少获得一枚金牌。 那金牌价值几何？ 今年的奥运金牌含有505克银和6克金——自1912年以来金牌就不是纯金的——其原始价值为950美元。 但巴黎的奥运冠军们希望，他们的夺金记忆是无价的。",

    "title": "日本股市“黑色星期一”后暴涨 美国经济衰退担忧犹存",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-69247220",
    "description": "22 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 周一日本股市盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”。 日本股市坐上“过山车”——周一（8月5日）暴跌，经历“黑色星期一”，周二则大幅反弹。 本周一，日经225指数跌12.4%，收报31506点，已抹去今年以来所有涨幅。其盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”，收盘跌幅12.4%则是日本股市历史上第二大跌幅。 不仅日本，亚洲股市普遍暴跌，韩国综合指数盘中跌幅一度扩大至10%，为2008年以来最大跌幅，收跌8.77%；台湾股市方面，台湾证交所加权股价指数收跌8.35%，为历史最大单日跌幅，其中台积电领跌大盘，股价跳水9.8%。此外，印度、澳洲、新加坡股指都在不同程度大跌。 到美国开盘时间，股市重挫，尤其是科技股。纳斯达克指数崩跌超过1000点，达6.34％；标普500跌3.65％。 这一轮大跌中，中国A股和香港股市躲过一劫，仅小幅下跌。 周二，日本股市又大幅反弹。开盘后一度涨幅超过10%，收复前一天大部分跌幅。韩国开盘上涨4%，台湾上涨3%。 三点原因导致暴跌 周一暴跌的原因何在？ 穆迪分析（Moody’s Analytics）列出了三点原因： 暴跌很大程度上反映了人们对美国可能走向衰退的担忧； 尽管经济数据不佳且通胀放缓，但日本央行上周三却意外上调了短期政策利率，并表示未来还将上调更多利率，日元因此飙升，而此举削弱了日本制造业的出口竞争力，因此日本股市受到打击尤为严重； 与人工智能相关的科技股也受到冲击，影响了台湾和韩国的股票估值，这些地区的芯片制造商生产了全球大部分用于人工智能应用的高端半导体。 换言之，恐慌情绪的源头来源于美国最近经济数据带来的担忧；日本因为恰好上调利率，导致日元飙升，连锁反应下，受伤尤为严重；而韩国、台湾受到连累，科技股受伤较重，而上述两国股市科技股成分较高，与美日市场关联也大。 上周五，美国公布就业数据，7 月份美国经济新增就业岗位 11.4 万个，低于投资者预期的 17.5 万个。失业率升到三年来最高水平，加重了市场对美国经济衰退的担忧，再加上中东动荡加剧，使市场抛售情绪在周一开盘时爆发。 受伤最终的日本股市更为独特。过去一年半，美联储维持高利率，日本央行则没有跟着升息，而是按兵不动。 因此，日元对美元不断贬值，投资者借机进行大量的套息交易。即投资者以日元进行廉价借贷，以美元或欧元进行高收益投资，同时拿到利息差和投资收益，这种交易蓬勃发展，使日币进一步走低。 对于日本公司而言，也乐于见到这种情况，因为日本企业有大量投资在海外，赚取美元，在日本的财报则用日元结算，使其收益增加，国际投资者在过去一年涌入日本股市，推高市场。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国纽交所交易员 但是，上周日本央行意外加息，将政策利率上调了15个基点。此举让投资者担忧；随着日本加息，日元可能升值，那么规模巨大的套息交易可能难以为继。 本周一，在美国经济预期的低迷情绪下，叠加日本加息的影响，全球投资者开始进行“套利交易逆转”（unwind）的操作，即卖出美元、港币等高利率资产，买回日元。而此前因为利差导致对日企收益的乐观情绪也不复存在，抛售就此展开。 美国经济真的要衰退了吗？ 有这种担忧，来自上周五公布的美国就业数据，7月份创造了11.4万个就业岗位，远低于预期的17.5万个，失业率也升至 4.3%，创下近三年来的新高，这触发了一个被称为“萨姆法则”（Sahm rule）的经济学法则。 该法则以美国经济学家克劳迪娅·萨姆（Claudia Sahm）的名字命名，它指出，如果三个月的平均失业率比过去12个月的最低水平高出半个百分点，那么这个国家就处于经济衰退的初期。 由此测算，美国7月份的失业率有所上升，因此三个月的平均失业率为4.1%。而去年的最低水平为 3.5%，高出0.6%，符合“萨姆法则”中衰退初期的条件。 更令人担忧的是，美国联邦储备委员会上周投票决定不降息。而其他发达经济体的中央银行，包括英格兰银行和欧洲中央银行，最近都降低了利率。 美联储维持利率不变，但其主席鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）称，9 月份降息是可以考虑的。这一表态引起了市场担忧——美联储采取行动的等待期是否太长了。 降息意味着借贷的成本更低，这在理论上应该会对经济起到促进作用。但如果就业数据表明经济已经开始下滑，那么人们就会担心美联储即便降息也为时已晚。 除此之外，还有科技公司及其股价。科技公司的股价长期上涨，部分原因是对人工智能（AI）的乐观情绪。上周，芯片制造巨头英特尔宣布裁员15，000人。与此同时，市场传言称竞争对手英伟达（Nvidia）可能不得不推迟发布新的人工智能芯片。 随之而来的是科技重镇美国纳斯达克指数（Nasdaq）的血洗。纳斯达克指数在几周前创下高点后，周五暴跌 10%。 这助长了整个市场的恐惧因素，而这正是危险所在。如果股市恐慌持续，股价继续暴跌，美联储有可能在9月份的下次会议之前介入，并降低利率。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国马里兰州一个地产项目 凯投宏观（Capital Economics）首席经济学家尼尔·希林（Neil Shearing）认为，“如果市场失调加深并开始威胁到具有系统重要性的机构和/或更广泛的金融稳定”，这种情况就可能发生。 但也有些好消息。“萨姆法则”的提出者本人在周一告诉美国媒体，“我们现在并没有陷入衰退。” 她补充说，“经济衰退并非不可避免，还有很大的降息空间。” 其他人则对就业数据持模棱两可的态度。 “虽然报告很糟糕，但并没有那么糟糕。”希林认为，最近席卷美国的飓风贝里尔可能是造成 7 月份薪资数据疲软的原因之一。其他数据显示劳动力市场正在降温，但并未崩溃。 希林补充说：“解雇人数似乎没有增加。” 而 7 月份平均每周工作时间的小幅下降并不意味着经济衰退， 他说。",

    "description": "33 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 中国官方一封文件称，要实施“网证”，这可能意味着中国网民可能未来要持证上网；此文件一出，即便在信息管理严格的中文互联网上，也引起巨大的反响，包括清华大学教授在内的学者也质疑此举监管过度。 不过，学者和大量网民的反对意见很快在中文社交媒体微博上遭删除。 该文件名为《国家网络身份认证公共服务管理办法（征求意见稿）》，由中国公安部，以及中国政府实施网络监管的主要机构“国家网信办”两部门共同起草。 值得注意的是，虽然该征求意见稿明确，意见建议反馈截止日期为8月25日，但“国家网络身份认证试点版”App已在中国多个手机应用商店上线，用户已可以通过身份核验，获得一张带有“网号”的电子网络身份凭证。同时该App试点应用已涵盖10个政务APP和71个互联网APP，包括淘宝、微信和小红书。 征求意见稿解释，网号，是指与自然人身份信息一一对应，由字母和数字组成、不含身份信息的网络身份符号；网证，是指承载网号及自然人非明文身份信息的网络身份认证凭证。网号、网证可用于在互联网服务及有关部门、行业管理、服务中非明文登记、核验自然人真实身份信息。 征求意见稿说明称，基于国家网络身份认证公共服务，自然人在互联网服务中依法需要登记、核验真实身份信息时，可通过国家网络身份认证APP自愿申领并使用“网号”和“网证”进行非明文登记、核验，无需向互联网平台等提供明文个人身份信息。“由此，可以最大限度减少互联网平台以落实‘实名制’为由超范围采集、留存公民个人信息。” 简而言之，该文件称，通过该系统，用户只需通过政府推出的App进行身份核验，而不需要把关键的个人信息交给淘宝等互联网平台，从而可以减少互联网各平台超范围采集和留存公民的个人信息。 图像来源， PA 反对意见：越权之嫌 对于征求意见期还未过，就已经开始试行。有微博网友称，征询意见的期限还没到就急吼吼地实行了，那还征询什么意见，与政府自己制定的《行政管理法》的法律法规都相冲突。 对于此征求意见稿持反对意见者众多，其中最受关注的是清华大学法学教授劳东燕。她发帖分析称，指出了其中三个问题：缺乏“上位法”，架空“自愿原则”，越权之嫌。 劳东燕称，《办法》的核心意思是准备推行网号与网证制度，但这样的举措不仅蕴含极大的社会风险，而且完全缺乏上位法的依据。《办法》虽提到自愿原则，却未对自愿原则的实现提供基本保障，考虑到自愿原则在中国语境下易于被架空的现实，该原则同样难以为网证制度提供正当依据。她说，保护个人信息只是一种幌子，目的是让社会控制变得常规化和规范化。 “我认为，以部门规章的形式推出网证制度缺乏正当性，明显存在越权之嫌，有必要提交全国人大宪法与法律委员会对《办法》进行合宪性审查。”劳东燕称。 对于上述“自愿原则”被架空的可能，北京大学法学院教授沈岿也提出担忧称，通常在鼓励推广之下，统一“网号”“网证”的使用会越来越普遍、越来越广泛。甚至，不排除实行实名制的网络平台将来直接要求用户使用“网号”“网证”登记，而不给用户选择的机会。 一篇流传颇广但已被删除的评论文章《我担心哪天我的上网证被吊销了》称，“网证”变成了一种白名单制度，即凭证才能上网，被许可后才能上网；它的危险性在于，任何人被处罚或者监管后，可能会吊销“网证”，那么是否就剥夺了个人的上网权利，而且以疫情管控为例，中国监管往往层层加码，那么这种级别的监管，终将“祸国殃民”。 图像来源， Getty Images 官方辩解：减少信息泄露 征求意见稿中有三点设置，似乎为了减少可能的争议：自愿原则、“最小化和必要性原则”、减少信息泄露。 征求意见稿提出，鼓励互联网平台按照自愿原则接入公共服务，用以支持用户使用网号、网证登记、核验用户真实身份信息，依法履行个人信息保护和核验用户真实身份信息的义务。 “最小化和必要性原则”，即公共服务平台处理个人信息不得超出为自然人提供“网号”“网证”相关服务所必需的范围和限度。 减少信息泄露。对于用网号网证通过验证的用户，互联网平台不得要求用户另行提供明文身份信息，法律、行政法规另有规定或者用户同意提供的除外。 中国政法大学副教授朱巍对中国官媒称，国家推出了统一认证的机构、统一的信息存储平台，俗称eID的“网号”“网证”制度，也可以理解成每个人在互联网上也有身份证。在统一的“网证”制度下，单个平台无法获取用户个人信息，能大幅减少信息泄露的风险。在统一的身份认证制度下，对于电信诈骗者可以全网封禁其网证，杜绝其更换平台、手机号复活的机会，有利于打击电信诈骗。 另有自媒体发文辩解称，“为社会公众统一签发‘网号’和‘网证’，实际上不是为了管理公众，而是为了治理平台。以我们现在的网络建设水平，个人的上网痕迹信息，哪怕你是匿名的，其实也被记录、可追踪，网号、网证制度不会强化既有能力。我国实行电话卡实名制已经有十一年了，我们用任何软件都需要手机号注册才能发布内容和评论，发布什么违法言论是会被查到的。我们的个人信息早已被掌握，但只要你遵纪守法，谁会去查你呢？”",

    "title": "BBC专访朝鲜“脱北”外交官李日奎: 金正恩希望特朗普当选美国总统",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69243751",
    "description": "珍妮·麦肯锡（Jean Mackenzie） BBC驻首尔记者 5 分钟前 图像来源， BBC / Hosu Lee 李日奎曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞，于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官。 投奔韩国的前朝鲜外交官李日奎（Ri Il Kyu 音译）认为， 平壤希望特朗普（Donald Trump 川普）当选美国总统。 因为若他重新入主白宫，那将是朝鲜（北韩）“千载难逢的机会”。 这位有着独特地位并了解平壤的外交官曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞。它于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为该国自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官，最近接受了BBC的访问。 今年52岁的李日奎曾经七次面对面与金正恩会面。当他去年与家人从古巴逃亡到首尔时，李日奎接受采访。他当时坦承，自己在平壤第一次见到金正恩时“浑身发抖，紧张不安。” 但之后的每次会面中他发现金正恩总是“微笑，心情愉悦”。 “他常常称赞别人，还会大笑，看起来像是一个普通人！”李日奎告诉BBC。 不过，李日奎又强调称他毫无疑问地认为金正恩会不惜一切代价确保自己的生存，即使这意味着要他杀了2500万朝鲜人民：“他本可以成为一个好人和好爸爸。但将他塑造成神话却使他成为了一个怪物。” 在他首次接受国际广播媒体的采访中，李日奎罕有分享他的观察，以助人们了解到这个世界上最神秘和最专制的国家想要实现的目标。李日奎强调，尽管2019年金正恩与特朗普的会谈破裂，但朝鲜仍然视这位前美国总统为可以就核武器计划与平壤谈判的人物。 朝鲜外交官为何叛逃？经济困难可能是重要原因 普京访朝：中国才是普京与金正恩背后的真正力量 闯入传说中“不存在”的朝鲜地标 历史性会面：特朗普“三八线”握手金正恩 过去，特朗普曾称赞与金正恩的关系是其任期内的一项重要成就，并还曾出了名地表示他们“敬爱对方”并互相写信。就在上个月的一场集会上，特朗普对支持者称，金正恩“想念”他,并希望他重新入主白宫。 据此，李日奎表示平壤希望利用这一亲密的个人关系来谋取利益，虽然这与平壤上月发表的一份官方声明相矛盾。该声明称朝鲜“不在乎谁当选美国总统。” 他又对BBC特别提到，称这个拥核国家永不会放弃核武，并可能寻求达成一项协议以冻结其核计划作为换取美国解除制裁之条件。但他补充称平壤不会真诚地进行谈判，而平壤同意冻结其核计划“是一个诡计，百分之百的欺骗”，与平壤在核武谈判是一种“危险的做法”,只会“协助朝鲜更强”。 图像来源， Handout 2019年特朗普跨越三八线的历史性时刻 “生死赌注” 在叛逃8个月后，李日奎现在与家人一起生活在韩国。在韩国警察保镖和两名情报人员的陪同下，他解释了自己决定背弃平壤之原因。 他表示，在朝鲜多年的生活要面对腐败、贿赂和缺乏自由。最后的导火线是他的颈椎滑脱需要动手术，但申请后被拒绝了。“我在朝鲜享有顶层阶级1%的生活，但那仍比韩国中产阶级家庭的生活还要糟糕。” 作为朝鲜在古巴的外交官，李日奎说他每月只赚500美元，因此他非法在中国贩售古巴雪茄来维持家计。当他最初告诉妻子想要逃亡的念头时，妻子吓得心脏出现问题，进了医院。之后他只在飞机起飞前6小时告诉妻子和孩子他的逃亡计划。他形容这是一次“生死赌注”。 在朝鲜，被抓的脱北者，如果是平民通常会被审问数月后获释。但对于像他这样的精英人士来说只有两种结局：被关进政治犯集中营或枪决。“担忧和恐惧让人无法承受。我可以接受自己的死，但我无法承受家人被拖进劳改营的想法！”他说。 李日奎称，尽管他从未相信上帝，但在机场门口焦急等待时他还是开始祈祷。 2016年以来，平壤最有名的高级别叛逃者是太永浩（Tae Yong-ho），他曾是朝鲜助英国副大使，最近被任命为韩国总统顾问委员会下“统一事务委员会”的新任主席。 谈到朝鲜最近与俄罗斯的更紧密关系，李日奎又说，乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料，甚至可能还有军事技术。他强调，这笔交易对平壤最主要的好处是能够继续发展其核武器。他还解释说，俄罗斯通过这笔交易制造了一个“漏洞”（loophole）使得金正恩能够“自由发展其核武器和导弹，加强其军事防御的同时无需向美国请求缓解制裁”。 图像来源， EPA 李日奎说乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料甚至可能还有军事技术。 但他表示，事实上金正恩明白与莫斯科的这种关系是暂时的。乌克兰战争结束后，俄罗斯很可能会断绝这种关系。因此，金正恩并未放弃与美国正常化关系的计划。 “朝鲜明白其生存的唯一道路，亦即消除遭受入侵的威胁、发展经济的唯一方式就是与美国关系正常化。” 虽然俄罗斯可能协助朝鲜暂时缓解了经济痛苦。但李日奎表示，在新冠大流行期间完全封闭国境“严重破坏了该国的经济和人民生活。”当2023年边境重新开放，朝鲜外交官准备回国时，李先生称，家人们要求他们“带回任何和所有你拥有的东西，甚至是你的旧牙刷！因为朝鲜一无所有了。” 金正恩要求其公民绝对忠诚，哪怕是一丝丝反对的气息也可能导致入狱。 但他强调，多年的痛苦生活已经侵蚀了朝鲜人的忠诚。因为，现在没有人再指望从最高领导人金正恩那里得到任何东西：“对政权或金正恩的忠诚不再是真的。那是被迫的忠诚，因为要不是忠诚，就是面临死亡。” “最邪恶的行为” 朝鲜最近的变化，主要是由于大量走私进入朝鲜的韩国电影、电视剧和音乐。这在朝鲜是非法的。据此，李日奎表示“朝鲜人观看韩国文化内容不是因为有资本主义信仰，而只是试图在单调而灰暗的生活中打发时间。但随后人们会问：“为什么南方人过着第一世界国家的生活，而我们却生活在贫苦之中?” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 脱北者讲述他们在朝鲜的生活 不过，李先生说，南韩文化产品正在改变朝鲜，但由于现有的控制系统，这些产品不可能导致朝鲜政权崩溃。“金正恩非常清楚，人民忠诚度正在下降，人们正在改变，这就是为什么他加强了恐怖统治的力度。” 平壤颁布了更严酷的法律用以惩罚那些消费和传播韩国文化商品的人。BBC去年采访了一名脱北者，他表示目睹有人因分享韩国音乐和电视节目而被处死。李日奎说，朝鲜去年年底放弃了数十年的最终与韩国统一的政策，这是进一步将朝鲜人民与韩国隔离的一次尝试。 李日奎将此描述为金正恩的“最邪恶的行为。”因为，所有朝鲜人都梦想着统一。他又向BBC解释说，,尽管过去的朝鲜领导人“偷走了人们的自由、金钱和人权”但金正恩却抢走了他们所剩不多的东西：希望。 在朝鲜之外，人们高度关注金正恩的健康状况。有人认为他可能过早去世，而这也许会导致政权的崩溃。 上一周，韩国情报机构估计金正恩的体重达140公斤，并面临心血管疾病的风险。但李日奎认为，朝鲜的监视和控制的系统已经建立得很牢固，以至于金正恩即便去世也不会危及这个专制政权。“会有另一个邪恶的领导者取代他的位置。” 还有人普遍猜测金正恩正在培养他年轻的女儿（据称名为金珠爱）作为他的继承人。但李先生驳斥了这种说法。他说，金氏家族用来证明其统治正当性是来自“神圣的白头山血统”，而且这被认为只能通过家族中的男性传承。因此，金珠爱缺乏成为朝鲜领导人的合法性和人气。他又说，起初人们对金珠爱很感兴趣，但现在已不再如此了。人民质疑她为什么要参加导弹试验而不是上学，为什么要穿奢侈的品牌服装而不是像其他孩子一样穿学校制服。 图像来源， Reuters 2019年特朗普与朝鲜领导人金正恩的历史性握手 李日奎认为，国际社会不应等待金正恩生病或死亡，而是要团结起来。包括朝鲜的盟友中国和俄罗斯“持续劝说平壤改变。” 他补充说这是唯一能结束朝鲜专制的方法。 最后，他说，希望他的叛逃能激励同伴，不是要他们也脱北，而是要他们从内部推动小的改变。他说，他并没有什么大的期望，比如朝鲜人能够投票或自由旅行。他只是希望人民能选择自己的工作，有足够的食物吃并能在朋友间自由地表达自己的言论。 不过，目前李日奎的优先事项是帮助家人适应在韩国的新生活，让孩子融入社会。 在采访结束时，他向我提出了一个假设情境说：“假如我提供你一个机会，如果成功我们会大赚一笔但失败就得死。你不会同意加入这个计划吧？这就是我强加在我妻儿身上的选择，而他们默默地同意并跟随我。” “这是一笔我必须终生偿还的债。” BBC韩语组权赫（Jake Kwon）和李浩水（Hosu Lee ）共同参与了此报导。",

    "description": "阿格尼娅（Aghnia Adzkia）, 武珍（Tran Vo） BBC国际部 56 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 自去年中柬“金龙”联合军演以来，柬埔寨的云壤海军基地迅速发展，并且有两艘疑似中国“江岛级”护卫舰的船只在此驻扎七个月，这引发了对该地区稳定的担忧。 根据BBC在军事专家的帮助下对BlackSky公司的实时卫星图像的分析，几乎整个190英亩的区域现在都被建筑物、道路和码头占据，仅有约8%的区域被树木或草地覆盖，而两年前这里绿色区域占了一半。 时任中国驻柬埔寨大使王文天在2022年6月举行的开工仪式上确认。中国“援助”了云壤海军基地升级改造项目。 中国官宣柬埔寨云壤海军基地“升级改造” 时间线与战略意义 两名军事专家对BBC称，卫星图片上两艘停靠在这里的护卫舰看起来像是中国护卫舰。 “它们是‘江岛级’护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11、14米，”一位要求匿名的军事情报分析师对BBC表示。 自2023年12月至2024年6月，这两艘船只一直在此停泊，比战略与国际研究中心（CSIS）早些时候记录的5个月时间更长。 战略与国际研究中心东南亚项目主任格雷戈里·B·波林（Gregory B Poling）表示，云壤基地将裨益中方。 “云壤基地的雷达跟踪系统可以帮助中国人民解放军在马六甲海峡和印太地区的行动，”波林在接受BBC采访时说。 在冲突情况下，该基地可以支持燃料补给、弹药和部署。 专家表示，如果中国护卫舰在基地的隐秘访问和隐藏任务继续下去，可能会引发“灾难性失败”。 位于柬埔寨西南的云壤海军基地距离新加坡只有1000公里。该基地位于重要战略位置，它靠近泰国湾的入口以及柬埔寨政府计划建设的该国最大运河的深水港西哈努克市。该基地还靠近马六甲海峡——国际航运路线的咽喉要道。 图像来源， Getty Images 地理位置示意图 基地的迅速扩建 柬埔寨雲壤海軍基地2022年以來的變化 2022年6月18日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 根据BlackSky给BBC提供的卫星图像分析，从2022年6月到2024年6月，两年内这里已经建成了14座大型建筑、一座码头和一片填海区域。 随着建设速度的加快，专家们认为中国帮助了柬埔寨政府。 “如果没有中国在资金、物流和建筑专业知识方面的大力援助，柬埔寨政府不可能建成这些设施，”朱拉隆功大学政治学与国际关系教授提提南·蓬苏迪拉克（Thitinan Pongsudhirak）对BBC表示。 “云壤使柬埔寨更加靠近中国主导东南亚大陆的轨道。因此，云壤将使柬埔寨在东盟成员国中坚定地成为中国的座上宾。” 他还认为，云壤基地似乎“违反了柬埔寨宪法中关于禁止建立外国军事基地的规定”。 前美国海军军官、美国新安全中心高级研究员托马斯·H·舒加特三世（Thomas H. Shugart III）也持有同样的看法，他表示，中国给予了柬埔寨的海军基地全力支持。 托马斯对BBC说：“我认为这是中国建造的，因为这些建筑让我想起我在中国海外基地吉布提和东南亚人工岛上看到的建筑。以目前的建设速度和规模，柬埔寨没有足够的能力完成。” 托马斯指出，云壤西部新建码头看起来与中国人民解放军在非洲吉布提的保障基地码头相似。 中国人民解放军驻吉布提保障基地和柬埔寨云壤海军基地对比图 “关于基地的其余部分，据传，属于中国部分的规模也与中国人民解放军在吉布提的基地规模大致相当，”托马斯补充说。 观察：中国在吉布提设军事基地干什么？ 然而，托马斯指出，他没有足够的证据向中国政府证实他的分析，因为这些只是通过卫星图像得出的。 BBC已联系中国国防部、中国外交部和柬埔寨国防部进行评论，但尚未收到任何回复。 然而，在其它地方，中国和柬埔寨均否认云壤是中国专用的海军基地。 根据中国大使王文天在奠基仪式上的讲话，中国对云壤海军基地升级项目的援助“符合两国国内法律、相关国际法律和国际惯例，不针对任何第三方”。 “中国军队将继续向柬埔寨军队提供力所能及的援助，促进两国军事合作的不断推进，达到新的水平和新进展。” 柬埔寨当地媒体表示，允许外国长年在其领土上建立基地违反了柬埔寨宪法第53条。但柬埔寨前总理洪森和其长子、现任总理洪玛奈一直向当地媒体否认这一说法。 柬埔寨宪法第53条禁止外国在其领土上建立军事基地。 第55条还规定，条约或协议应保障柬埔寨的独立、主权、领土完整、中立性和国家统一。 BBC对基地的五个区域进行的观察发现：北部、中部、东部、东南部和南部每个区域都呈现出快速扩建的趋势 。 云壤基地新建筑群 在东部，从2022年6月到12月仅仅六个月的时间，柬埔寨政府清理了大约24英亩的土地，并开始堆放一些混凝土。一年后，已经建起了四栋大楼。 托马斯认为“这可能是营房（右边两栋）或行政建筑（左边两栋），中间有一个运动场，旁边的两栋直角形建筑似乎是停车场或车辆存储地/车库”。 2023年8月到12月期间，在同一区域他们还建造了四个油罐，然后在2024年4月底将它们涂成蓝色。 在基地的中部，他们从2023年3月开始建造一个新的码头，并于2023年10月完工。两个月后，上述两艘船只停靠在码头上，至少停留了七个月，直到2024年6月。 柬埔寨政府拆除了云壤海军基地北部的旧建筑 他们从东北部开始清理土地。自2022年6月以来的大约两年时间里，他们已经建起了四栋大楼、四栋小楼和一些未知设施。 从2024年2月到6月，柬方似乎在沿海地区拆除旧建筑，并计划建造其他建筑。他们还开辟一些新路径。 大规模整理土地并在云壤海军基地南面新建一座码头 2023年10月，他们在南部清理了一些土地，随后几个月进行了填海造地工作。一年后，混凝土被铺设在那里，一些驳船似乎在新建的码头处进行着什么工作。托马斯说：“可能是运送建筑材料或其他东西来回穿梭。”2024年6月，卫星图像显示出一个新的U形码头。 在东南部，一片清理过的土地上共建起了六栋建筑。随着建筑的扩建，新修的道路清晰可见。小楼扩建旁边还有一些小的单元。 “正在建造的东西与2019年 泄露给媒体的谅解备忘录 (MOU)显示了相似之处。借助中国的技术基础设施和工人，基地面积的三分之一将用于柬埔寨海军，基地北部的三分之二将留给中国独家使用，”波林说。 “他们希望我们关注基地的南部那三分之一，并忽略北部保留为中国独家使用的其余三分之二。” “中国军人可能驻扎在基地” 疑似中国军舰在该基地停留数月引发争议。波林告诉《日经新闻》称，有可能这些护卫舰搭载了士兵进行“轮换或长期驻扎”。 “这意味着在过去的五个月里可能有中国士兵驻扎在这个基地。” 上述匿名军事情报分析员告诉BBC，两艘中国江岛级护卫舰于2023年12月1日首次停靠在云壤，和亚洲自由电台（Radio Free Asia）报道的他们在2023年12月3日抵达参加军事联合演习比起来要更早两天。 2023年12月1日至2024年5月19日，这两艘护卫舰只离开云壤三次，它们总是成对移动，“在任何时候都不会有一艘船在场而另一艘不在”。 2024年6月12日，尽管中国和柬埔寨联合演习已于2024年5月底结束，这些军舰仍停留在那里。 “这些是江岛级护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11.14米，”该分析员告诉BBC。 2023年12月初，柬埔寨国防部长在其 脸书帖子 上确认，这些船只帮助柬埔寨海军准备联合军事训练。然而，在5月的联合军演结束后，它们似乎待了更长时间。 江岛级护卫舰 根据《高棉时报》的 报道 ，早在2020年，即这些护卫舰出现之前，柬埔寨前总理洪森就有承诺，柬埔寨政府将允许所有军舰停靠新建的现代化海军云壤基地。 “关于对云壤基地的使用权，我想声明，我们欢迎来自所有国家的船只，包括美国、法国、加拿大、印度、英国、日本、澳大利亚，而不仅仅是中国，来港口停靠或与柬埔寨共同参加演习。声称柬埔寨已经授予中国50至90年独家使用权这一说法毫无根据。” 然而，就近期中国对该基地的独家使用权问题，值得注意的是根据《高棉时报》报道，2024年2月，两艘日本海上自卫队的驱逐舰在西哈努克港、而不是云壤基地的自主港口停靠了2天。 2023年12月到2024年6月雲壤基地出現中國江島級輕護衛艦 2023年12月1日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 为什么中国的存在对其他国家发出了警告？ 根据美国国防部丹尼尔·K·伊诺耶亚太安全研究中心（Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies of the US Department of Defense）的亚历山大·L·维文教授（Alexander L Vuving）的说法，通过在西部的云壤基地和东部的南沙群岛掌握双向通道，也就是在中国南部海域的纷争岛之间，中国可以完全控制一个非常广阔的区域，包括整个东南亚地区的中心。 “也就是说有了一个可以实时观测监控当下发生的所有事情的雷达，更别提还有一个基地来指挥船只和车辆来控制领空、海域或附近地区了。这也是一种可能性，”维文说。 中国解放军筹划打造“全球后勤补给网”令五角大楼担忧 中国一直在南海实施灰色地带战术——这是军事术语，指的是在战争和和平之间周旋的策略，在不实施武装力量的情况下实现在当地的利益最大化。 “南海冲突不符合中国的利益。如果发生南海冲突，美国可能会作为菲律宾的盟国介入，那么对中国来说事情将变得非常棘手。”维文补充道。 美国军队在菲律宾有外国军事基地。现在随着中国在云壤基地的存在，中国可以部署民兵、军力并拦截信息。 与此观点相同，东亚政治分析师、昆士兰大学讲师艾哈迈德·乌马尔（Ahmad Umar）表示，中国在该基地的存在可能激怒其它邻国。 “首先，中国可以干扰卫星传输消息，其次，这可能破坏该地区的稳定，无法和平解决南海冲突。这也可能引发灾难性后果，不仅威胁到地区的稳定，也威胁到中美关系甚至台湾冲突。”乌马尔告诉BBC。 乌马尔认为，中国决定不将云壤宣布为其海军基地是一种军事战略，目的是阻止美国在中台冲突爆发时支持台湾。 一种转变：从美国到中国 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 在中国获得使用基地的权利很久以前，美国一直是柬埔寨军方的积极合作伙伴。自2010年以来，美国在军事设施的北部资助了两栋建筑，并与柬埔寨共同进行军事训练。 然而在2017年，就在两国联合协作的年度训练之前，柬埔寨突然宣布暂停这项已经持续多年的合作。 2019年，有关中国和柬埔寨关于云壤基地的协议文件被泄露给媒体，并被《华尔街日报》报道。根据文件，柬埔寨允许中国军队使用该基地北半部长达30年，并在此期满后自动续约。 2020年，日经亚洲报道称，一栋由美国资助的建筑被拆除，为中国的新建设让路。 2021年6月，美国副国务卿温迪·谢尔曼（Wendy Sherman）在访问柬埔寨时，他对中国军方的存在、美国资助建筑被强拆以及在云壤海军基地设施的情况表示高度担忧。 在美国政府网站上的一份声明中，谢尔曼表示，“中华人民共和国在柬埔寨设立军事基地将损害柬埔寨的主权，威胁地区安全，并对美柬关系产生负面影响。” 在会议之后，美国国防武官马库斯·M·费拉拉上校（Marcus M. Ferrara）被邀请到基地。然而，他没有完全访问权。对此，柬埔寨政府发言人菲·西潘（Phay Siphan）回应称，他们可以基于国家安全和领土完整的理由限制访问。 “问题在于柬埔寨的行动缺乏透明度。没有人知道哪些区域是为中国保留的，因为柬埔寨和中国都没有宣布。尽管柬埔寨方面总是说他们永远不会让外国在他们的国家建立军事基地，但关于这一点的真相是未知的，”维文在接受BBC采访时表示。 来自柬埔寨未来论坛的研究员安诚波（Chhengpor Aun）告诉BBC：“这种情况（柬埔寨承接外国海军基地）将需要柬埔寨宪法的改变，这可能会引起国内和国际的强烈反对。我不认为柬埔寨政府会冒这个风险，但我无法推测整个大背景下可能会存在的其他安排。” “如果成功升级和适当部署，云壤将在柬埔寨海军防御中发挥核心作用，以加强对泰国湾的海上主权，并为该国对海上安全日益积极的贡献提供支持。” 经过两年的快速发展，中国和柬埔寨一直在积极利用这一基地进行联合军事演习——在六个月内进行了两次。 根据柬埔寨国防部，最近的演习涉及2075名士兵和武器，包括来自柬埔寨的1315名士兵和中国武装部队的760名士兵。 中国和柬埔寨的关系越来越紧密。波林怀疑柬埔寨政府邀请中国到基地的隐藏议程是由腐败政府推动的。 “柬埔寨越来越倾向于中国这一现实源于柬埔寨人民党（CPP）领导的政权，现在洪玛奈基本上正在实行盗窃统治——他们正在寻找赞助商，需要资金来维持体系。如果资金耗尽，该党将崩溃，”波林对BBC说。 “中国是他们唯一可以赚钱的地方。只要中国继续向柬埔寨注入资金，不管洪森、洪玛奈喜欢与否，他们别无选择，只能继续成为北京的客户。” 然而，他补充道：“这并不意味着柬埔寨将永远被中国逼入困境。我认为柬埔寨人民越来越怀疑中国，并将中国视为腐败之源。” “因此，只有在洪森和洪玛奈掌权期间，这个网络才能生存下去。” 制图：Aghnia Adzkia, Andro Saini, Arvin Supriyadi and Ayu Idjaja",

    "description": "5 分钟前 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 中华台北队女拳手林郁婷 在巴黎奥运，女子拳击选手接连陷入性别争议风波，包括阿尔及利亚代表凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）及来自台湾的林郁婷。 她们去年曾遭国际拳击协会（IBA）取消资格，理由是未能通过性别测试，指她们有XY染色体。但国际奥委会（IOC）称，国际拳击协会作出相关决定时，没有任何正当程序。 国际奥委会主席巴赫（Thomas Bach）公開为两名选手辩护，呼吁停止仇恨言论。 “我们有两位拳击手，她们作为女性出生，作为女性成长，拥有女性护照，并作为女性参加了多年的比赛。”他説。“这就是女性的明确定义。她们作为女性的身份从未有过任何疑问。” 乔安娜·哈珀：运动员、科学家和致力保障女子体育的跨性别者 东京奥运：位于话题中心的跨性别举重选手哈伯德 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 赛场上发生什麽？ 28岁的台湾（以中华台北队名义参赛）拳击手林郁婷，周四（8月2日）在其首场奥运比赛中胜出。 她在欢呼声中进入赛场，并於女子57公斤级8强赛事赢了乌兹别克选手图尔迪别科娃（Sitora Turdibekova），现场传出一些嘘声。 图像来源， Ueslei Marcelino/REUTERS 这场赛事打满了三个回合，两人打完短暂握手，但在五名裁判一致判定林郁婷获胜后，她们没有再握手。 图尔迪贝科娃流泪离开赛场，没有停下来接受媒体采访，和她的团队迅速离开赛场。林郁婷则短暂停留，没有回答问题。 台湾媒体引述林郁婷的教练曾自强表示，希望林郁婷不要受外界打扰，不走进采访区，“外国媒体想问相关问题，她不知怎麽回答，有点吓到了”。 此前，阿尔及利亚选手凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）在女子66公斤16强赛事，赢了意大利选手卡里尼（Angela Carini）。 图像来源， YAHYA ARHAB/EPA-EFE 後者在比赛第46秒时宣布弃赛，她拒绝与对手握手，在赛场上跪地落泪，赛後表示“我必须保住自己的生命”。 但卡里尼翌日向对手道歉，称“如果国际奥委会说她可以比赛，我尊重这个决定”。 国际拳协与国际奥委会之争 这次性别风波背後，是国际拳击协会（IBA）与国际奥委会（IOC）之争。 去年3月，有俄罗斯背景的国际拳协在世界锦标赛称林郁婷和凯莉芙“不符合规则”，取消她们的资格。林郁婷的铜牌因此被剥夺。 国际拳协当时称，此举是“为了维护比赛的公平性和最高诚信度”。俄籍主席克里姆列夫（Umar Kremlev）对俄罗斯媒体表示，该会发现有关运动员有XY染色体。 但该判决引发外界质疑，国际拳协进行了“单独且公认的测试”，但一直没有说明是哪种测试，也没有让她们接受睾固酮素检查──睾固酮是男女都有的性激素，而成年男性的睾固酮水平约是成年女性的10到20倍。 到了去年6月，国际拳协因管理不善、贪污等指控，被国际奥委会取消其世界认可地位，奥运拳击赛事改为由国际奥委会自行主持。 不过，国际奥委会上周仍在其网站仍一度引述国际拳协对林郁婷的性别质疑，几天之后才删除相关内容。 上周初，国际奥委会在其媒体信息门户网站上表示，林未能通过“基于生化测试结果的资格要求”。该网站还提到：“这是自国际拳协开始使用新测试方法以来，首次有中华台北运动员被要求进行性别资格的生化测试。” 然而，国际奥委会在几天之后删除了这些信息。 国际奥委会在周四的一份声明中表示，凯莉芙和林成为了“国际拳协突如其来且武断决定的受害者”。 声明指出：“在2023年国际拳协世界锦标赛接近尾声时，他们在没有任何正当程序的情况下突然被取消资格。” “根据国际拳协网站上的会议记录，这一决定最初是由国际拳协秘书长和行政总裁单独做出的。国际拳协董事会仅在事后才批准了该决定，并随后要求在未来类似情况中制定和反映在国际拳协规章中的程序。记录还指出，国际拳协应该‘建立一个明确的性别测试程序’。 “对这两名运动员的当前攻击完全基于这一武断的决定，这一决定是在没有任何正当程序的情况下做出的，尤其是考虑到这些运动员已经参加高水平比赛多年。 “这种做法违反了良好治理原则。” 国际奥委会是根据运动员护照来定义性别。在争议声中，国际奥委会主席巴赫8月3日为两位拳手辩护，表示从没怀疑两人是女性。 图像来源， Carlos Perez Gallardo/REUTERS 巴赫说现在看到的是，有些人想要拥有女性的定义。“我只能请他们提出一个基于科学、新的女性定义。为什么一个出生、成长、参加比赛并拥有女性护照的人不能被视为女性？” 他强调国际奥委会愿意倾听，愿意调查，“但我们不会参与出于政治动机的文化战争”，又指社交媒体上一切“仇恨言论”和政治动机引发的辱骂完全不可接受。 一些台湾媒体去年报道称，林郁婷未通过测试是由于“体重控制和月经周期”药物影响了荷尔蒙水平。 “我男变女，喜欢女生，一点不柔弱”：专访香港罕有跨性别武术家 林郁婷是谁？ 28岁的林郁婷身高175厘米，至今取得40胜14负，曾三次获得世锦赛奖牌，两次获得亚洲冠军。 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 台湾媒体报道，林郁婷1995年出生於新北莺歌，小时候和哥哥一起观看日本知名拳击动漫《第一神拳》，主角幕之内一步本来是性格懦弱、受霸凌的高中生，後来转变成为职业拳王。林郁婷受啓发，从练田径转为练拳击。 而她的教练曾自强曾经透露， 林出身於家暴家庭，她希望保护母亲而学习拳击。 她留短头发、打扮中性，去年被国际拳协剥夺铜牌后曾形容，自己好像岳飞被冠上了莫须有罪名。 “我参与这个协会的比赛那麽多次，光世锦赛就七次，怎麽只有这次说我有问题。不能因为我的长相打扮不同於传统女性的样貌，就这样对我。他们也没有公布检测过程，直接给出一张纸就说结果不符合，这就是违反流程的事。” 凯莉芙是谁？ 25岁的凯莉芙身高178厘米，从2018年开始参加比赛，以9胜5负的战绩进入巴黎赛。 她上届在东京首次参加奥运会，在八强赛事中输给爱尔兰选手哈灵顿（Kellie Harrington），当时她并没有被质疑性别。 去年她进入新德里的世锦赛决赛，但开赛前一天被主办方取消资格。 图像来源， Ramzi Boudina/REUTERS 凯莉芙父亲 这次在巴黎奥运再被质疑性别，凯莉芙的父亲对天空新闻表示：“我的孩子是个女孩。” “她从小就被当作女孩养大。她是一个坚强的女孩。我教育她要勤奋勇敢。她有很强的工作和训练意志。” 他向路透社表示，女儿从六岁起就热爱体育运动，以女儿为荣，并展示凯莉芙的出生证明文件说：“这是我们家的官方文件，1999 年5月2日，伊曼-凯莉芙，女。这里写着，你可以看一下，这份文件不会说谎。”",

    "description": "李澄欣 BBC中文记者 30 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 江旻憓（左）的教练是罗马尼亚的塔维（右）。 香港剑击队在巴黎奥运三天内夺两金，30岁的江旻憓先反胜东道主法国选手在女子重剑（Épée）封后，紧跟着27岁的张家朗卫冕男子花剑（Foil）金牌，成为68年来该项目卫冕第一人。 根据国际剑击联会（FIE）最新排名，香港运动员占据两个单项排名世界第一——江旻憓以总分262分保持女子世界一姐地位，张家朗则以252分重返男子世界第一。 香港人口仅700多万，却能持续出现世界一流剑手，站稳世界顶尖队伍之位。圈内人士称，全港习剑人数保守估计多达2万人，主要来自大中小学校队以及香港剑击总会旗下近50间私人剑校。 BBC中文采访多名剑击队运动员、教练和学者，拆解香港剑击运动的崛起缘由，并回溯这项运动如何从殖民地贵族项目发展成为今天在中产阶级普及的运动。 香港奥运代表团历史佳绩和未能摆脱的政治阴影 香港赢得久违奥运金牌 张家朗获得男子花剑冠军 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 东西合璧的训练体系 “她一定没问题的。”江旻憓决赛落后法国对手时，在电视直播节目以运动员身分当旁述的朱嘉望淡定地说。 图像来源， Getty Images 她没有说错，江旻憓最终逆转胜夺金。朱嘉望接受BBC中文访问时说：“我当时这么坚定地说，是因为我很相信Vivian（江旻憓）的实力。我看过她跟同一位对手打过很多次，每一次都是前段落后、后面追赢。” 29岁的朱嘉望是江旻憓的队友，上届东京奥运她们首次打入奥运女子剑击团体赛，两人都是香港体育学院（体院）的全职精英运动员，每周训练六天共25至30小时，上午炼体能，下午进行对打和技术训练。 该队以前由华人担任教练，2011年总教练郑兆康上任后大幅改革，聘请一批欧洲世界级教练，包括张家朗的法国人教练Gregory Koenig（Greg）和江旻憓的罗马尼亚教练Octavian-Petru Zidaru（Tavi）。郑兆康形容，十多年来打下的基础，现在是“收成期”，朱嘉望也表示这彻底改变了队内训练文化，给运动员全新的思维。 “Greg的风格是给运动员多一些放松时间，但一练习就很专注和高强度，这样才更加平衡，让人更加享受到练习和比赛。Tavi的风格也是不会把你逼得好紧，反而较讲究技术和细节。” 图像来源， Getty Images 张家朗的教练是法国人格雷各（Gregory Koenig，Greg） 她说教练团队也有来自香港本地、中国大陆和韩国的亚洲人，亚洲教练较重视基本功，因此港队成员都有“教科书水平”的标准手势和步法，打剑速度也非常快，在此基础上接受欧洲教练的训练就更上一层楼。 “不同国籍的教练互相配合很重要，以我们女子重剑为例，Tavi用欧洲模式做主，而中国教练姜海涛会配合他，他更了解亚洲人的身高、体型特性，知道如何把欧洲那一套改良和应用在我们身上。”朱嘉望对BBC中文说，“这样我们东西方的优点都兼备，而始终剑击是欧洲主导的运动，熟悉欧洲人的思维就更适合打欧洲对手。” 在巴黎卫冕金牌的张家朗也曾受访透露，法国教练格雷各加盟港队的第一法则是“你必须open-minded（思维开放）”，他要求运动员改掉“苦练就是好”的观念，鼓励他们了解自己而不是盲目遵守规矩，这启发了张家朗打剑时不只看招式的表面，还要思考每一个“为什么”。 图像来源， Moonie Chu 从左到右依次为中国教练姜海涛、江旻憓、余缮妡、陈渭泠、朱嘉望以及罗马尼亚教练Tavi 心态与海外经验 张家朗在决赛对战意大利的马基（Filippo Macchi），对方及其教练在整场赛事都被指十分“火爆”，失分时手舞喧叫及向裁判施压。“决一剑”时，双方曾两度刺中对方，裁判判定攻击无效，直到第三剑才判张家朗获胜，过程充满戏剧性。 而江旻憓决赛对阵东道主法国的剑手玛露比顿（Auriane Mallo-Breton）时，现场法国观众呐喊声沸腾，法国总统马克龙也亲自到场观战，她在巨大压力下初段落后，三个回合后追平并“决一剑”胜出。 图像来源， Getty Images 两人能在短时间内调整心态被视为致胜关键，没有受现场气氛或对手情绪干扰。对此，同为港队成员的朱嘉望认为，除了教练的启发，体院的运动心理中心也应记一功。 她说该院有数名心理学家，其中两位负责照顾剑击队，经常在训练期间观察运动员的心理状态，并会随队一同去亚锦赛、世锦赛、奥运等重要赛事。 “我们和他经常见，他很熟悉我们，我们也随时可以找他聊天，是他教会了我冥想，怎样在高压环境下把专注力放在当下，这些思想的练习对于比赛帮助很大。”朱嘉望说，“因为剑击好像下棋，不是斗体力，更多的是斗智、斗心、斗经验，心理质素是关键。” 另一方面，香港剑击队非常重视海外交流，运动员每年要到海外参加七、八个比赛，包括剑击世锦赛、亚锦赛和世界杯，教练会在赛事之间安排为期两周至一个月的海外集训，每年至少四次，让运动员适应时差和累积国际经验。 “所以我们经常去法国，每个剑击队成员都很熟悉巴黎。”朱嘉望笑道。 她说在海外集训也是跟着原有教练，但气氛会比平日更专注，也可以与各国对手切磋，并观摩其它国家教练的教法。“例如在去年世锦赛前的集训，一位日本教练带领了一个环节，教所有剑手脚法，我们学到以前从没学过的技巧。” 朱嘉望补充指，全世界的剑击队都有海外集训，是常态，但港队在这两届奥运前的预备时间里，明显投放了更多资源，“总教练安排给我们的集训多了很多，而成绩也反映出是值得的”。 殖民地时期的历史渊源 香港剑击队有今天的“收成期”，有赖过去几十年来播下的种子。而追溯剑击运动在香港的历史渊源，得回到港英时代。 图像来源， Getty Images 除了张家朗、江旻憓之外，香港还有年轻剑手崭露头角，例如19岁新星陈诺斯（前排右二）。 剑击是欧洲运动，香港作为前英国殖民地，二战前已有剑击爱好者，主要是洋人，一批葡藉剑手在二战期间移居澳门并接受前葡萄牙奥运选手训练，战后回流香港，其后在港的英军剑手也开始参与本地剑击活动，促成1949年成立香港业余剑击总会，并获加入英联邦剑击协会。 上世纪五十年代，这项运动慢慢打进华人精英阶层，喇沙、拔萃等由教会办学的传统名校陆续成立剑击校队，1960年举办第一届校际剑击比赛，带动其它名校的剑击风潮。 “英国人到海外拓展殖民地，都会把英国的运动文化输出去，包括剑击、足球、羽毛球等，而这些变成英联邦体育文化，香港受影响很深。”香港教育大学健康与体育学系高级讲师雷雄德博士对BBC中文说。 这些传统名校可说是香港第一代剑击运动员的摇篮，以剑击闻名的前财政司司长曾俊华，就是60年代初中就读喇沙书院时首次接触剑击。 他高中移居美国后继续学剑，大学时曾任麻省理工学院读书剑击队队长，80年代回港后到母校喇沙担任义务剑击教练，一教就是30年，不少港队现役剑手都曾是他的学生，包括曾出战上届东京奥运、目前世界排名第20的男子花剑运动员蔡俊彦。 时至今日，会剑击的小孩报读名校时仍可获加分，足见剑击在香港精英阶层的传统地位。 而剑击从上世纪六七十年代的名校小圈子运动，到八十年代逐渐普及化，转捩点也跟殖民地政策息息相关。 “二战前后，各国把体育纳入国家政策，关乎教育、生产力、军事训练和国家荣誉。但香港不是一个国家，殖民地政府也不重视体育，情况在六七暴动后改变。”雷雄德博士说。 1967年“六七暴动”后港英政府改变治港方针，引入多项社会改革，开始重视青年政策并注重体育发展，举办包含竞技比赛在内的“香港节”，1973年成立康乐体育局。 “政府认为年轻人太多‘剩余精力’无处发泄才会参与暴动，所以开始推广体育。英国政府在处理英国本土青年犯罪问题时也是这个思维。”雷雄德博士说，“在学术上，体育本身就有凝聚社会的功能，可以净化社会不安。” 两万剑手的城市 1982年，港英政府与赛马会合资在沙田成立银禧体育中心，即香港体育学院前身，负责培训精英运动员及推广体育活动，成立之初剑击已是九个重点项目之一，正式把剑击带到社区。 图像来源， Getty Images 雷雄德忆述，他上世纪八十年代初刚从师范学院体育系毕业，曾参加教育司署与银禧合办给体育教师的课程，进修冷门项目如剑击、独木舟、射击等。“教师学会了，带回一般的中小学，基层学生才接触到，造就年轻人有兴趣。现在的剑击总会高层当初也是这样学剑的。” 与此同时，银禧训练出一批精英剑击运动员，九十年代退役后成为教练人才，纷纷在民间开办私人剑击学校。 53岁的前剑击港队成员李永强就是其中一人，他1998年曾代表香港出战亚运会，退役后担任教练，2012年开办私人剑校香港剑击学院，见证着剑击社群壮大。“我30年前玩剑击，全香港才500多人，现在只是一个小学学界比赛已经有两三千人。” 他对BBC中文指出，以前剑击是贵族活动，但随着香港经济起飞、中产阶级崛起，可负担的家庭越来越多，小孩也越来越早开始学习，从中学阶段逐渐提前至小学、幼稚园，最早的甚至3岁就开始学。他说以中小学学界比赛分别有两三千人参加，加上幼儿、大专和成人，保守估计目前全港习剑人数多达2万人。 “张家朗也是这样出来，基层越多人玩、越早开始玩，我们选材基础就越扩大，选出来的精英就越强。体院集中训练精英，私人剑校负责基层推广，这30年来做了很好的分工，建立了整个系统——所以金牌不是突然冒出来的，是三代人的努力。” 新一代剑手 香港剑击运动的成就能否持续，要靠第四代人的努力。张家朗在巴黎奥运卫冕后受访时说，香港是个很小的城市，但“只要相信自己，不要因为（生于）一个很小的地方而放弃”。 图像来源， Getty Images 和他同代学剑的年轻教练贺扬则认为，正正是香港地方小，有很大优势，参加比赛很方便。 “外国地方大，小孩要去别的剑会比赛，可能要整个家庭一起出行、去好几天，但香港胜在够密集，一个尖沙咀已经有六七间剑校，就算去澳门或内地也很近，可以当天来回，这样我们的比赛经验相比其他国家的人更丰富。” 三年前东京奥运后的张家朗效应，让香港剑校如雨后春筍，目前香港剑击总会旗下属会有近50家。 贺扬也是在两年前创办剑校英汇剑击学院，他说他这一辈人棒做社区推广，开始革新教学模式，“不想像以前那种高压教育，把小孩逼得很紧，反而是营造快乐打剑的气氛”。他又认为新一代的剑校文化已经改变，更愿意互相合作，相信可吸引更多人投身剑击运动。 “我小时候学剑的体验很差，你愿意给钱他都未必肯教，就算教也是挤牙膏式，山头主义很严重。但我们这一代，成长于网络时代，所有资讯都很透明，更加愿意分享资源和合作，这样对整个剑击界都有好处。” 除了私人剑击学校，一般的中小学也对剑击持更开放态度。 本身是剑击教练的何莉恺在新界沙田区一家中学任教，她一年前在校内成立剑击队，目前有13人。她说当初向校长提出建议后，校方爽快答应。 图像来源， AFP “首先要多谢张家朗效应，让所有香港人认识了剑击。”她笑道。 “其次是用成本说服校长，其实剑击没有大家想像中那麽贵，教练费跟篮球队差不多，场地一个羽毛球场已经符合要求，只是买个裁判器，一般学校都可以承担。” 她补充指，自从国际剑联认可中国制造的服装和器材，市面上已有大量平价装备可供选择，投身剑击的门槛大大降低，现在背景较基层的南亚裔学生也积极参与，种族更多元化。 对此，学者雷雄德和前港队成员李永强都表示乐见，相信随着基层选手人数增多、种族更多元，香港剑击队将一代胜过一代。 “其实现在的学生，已经比张家朗小时候更厉害，以后的成绩非常令人期待。”李永强说。",

    "description": "12 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 拜登看着格什克维奇在抵达美国后给母亲一个大大的拥抱。 包括《华尔街日报》记者伊凡·格什科维奇（Evan Gershkovich）在内的三名美国人在与俄罗斯进行的囚犯交换协议中获释。美国囚犯都已安全返回美国领土。美国总统拜登（Joe Biden）和副总统卡马拉·哈里斯（kamala harris）亲自前往机场迎接他们，获释囚犯每个人都与家人拥抱。 32岁的格什科维奇是从俄罗斯监狱被交换的16名囚犯之一。俄国并接回了8名在美服刑的俄罗斯囚犯。 此次被称为冷战结束以来美俄两国最大规模的换囚行动。 这个在土耳其机场进行的换囚行动释放了前美国海军陆战队员保罗·惠伦（Paul Whelan）以及拥有俄美双重国籍的另一名记者阿尔苏·库尔马谢娃（Alsu Kurmasheva）。 在抵达马里兰州的美军安德鲁联合基地后，格什科维奇等三人从飞机上走下来，受到现场人员的热烈欢呼。 他们在机场跑道上停留拍照和交谈，不到一小时就离开了空军基地。拜登的车队也随后离开。 在他们返回美国之际，拜登在机场欢迎他们获释归来，并称“他们受的残酷折磨已经结束了”。 拜登在现场说：“想像一下，若你被不公平地扣押而你的孩子就在家里，你会有什么感受？” 他又补充称“想像在监狱里，不知何时才能回家。不知道孩子们的状况，他们晚上是否哭着入睡？每天你不在他们身边都是如何度过的？这些都很重要。” 拜登亦赞扬了美国盟友特别是德国和斯洛文尼亚所发挥的作用，并将格什科维奇等三人获释以及克里姆林宫批评人士弗拉基米尔·卡拉-穆尔扎（Vladimir Kara-Murza）的释放称为“外交成就”。 三名获释的美国公民将被送往德州的布鲁克陆军医院进行健康检查。 美伊完成换囚：美国解冻60亿美元伊朗资金，五名被押美公民飞离伊朗 美俄换囚 女篮明星与“死亡商人”各自获释返国 普京80年代的东德特工证件在德国曝光 澳大利亚华裔记者成蕾获释回国 曾遭“泄密”指控和判刑 图像来源， US Government 白宫发布的照片显示格什科维奇(左)、库尔马谢娃(右)和惠伦(右二)等人在从俄罗斯被囚中获释后登上飞机。 谈判历时18个月 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 事实上，此次交换协议的谈判历时超过18个月。 关键在于莫斯科要求返还在德国服刑的俄国杀手瓦季姆·克拉西科夫（瓦迪姆·克拉西科夫）。他被指控曾在柏林市中心公园被毒杀流亡海外的前车臣叛军指挥官甘戈什维利（Zelimkhan Khangoshvili）。 克拉西科夫现已返回俄罗斯。 土耳其总统府则称，共有24名来自7个不同国家的囚犯在土耳其安卡拉交换，其中包括美国、德国、波兰、斯洛文尼亚、挪威、俄罗斯和白俄罗斯的囚犯。其中10人（包括2名未成年人）被遣返至俄罗斯，13名囚犯被送至德国，3人送抵美国。 在俄罗斯，普京在莫斯科机场亲自用花束迎接获释的俄罗斯人。他在红毯上热情地拥抱了他们，并表示他们将获得国家奖励。除了克拉西科夫，还有一对在斯洛维尼亚被判间谍罪的俄罗斯夫妇，他们和两个孩子一起返回俄罗斯。 北约和欧洲联盟都欢迎这次释放并称这是由土耳其斡旋达成的。德国公民李科·克里格尔（Rico Krieger）此前在白俄罗斯被判处死刑，但本周白俄罗斯领导人卢卡申科对他进行了赦免，他也已获释。 事实上，此前关于交换囚犯的讨论曾包括当时被监禁的俄罗斯反对派领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexander Lukashenkoe）。但是当他在今年2月份于北极监狱以不明原因去世时，此交换方案濒临报废。他的遗孀尤利娅·纳瓦尔娜（Yulia Navalnaya）称此次换囚让她感到欣喜。 在换囚前几天就有消息传出各国即将进行的一次重大换囚。而且在此之前，数名在俄罗斯被监禁的异见人士和记者被从监狱转移到不明地点。尽管俄罗斯秘密转移囚犯较常见，但知名的囚犯大量失踪并不寻常。 过去最近一次高调换囚发生在2022年12月。当时美国篮球明星布兰妮·格莱纳（Brittney Griner）在阿布达比机场被交换回美国，莫斯科换回了在美监狱服刑12年的俄罗斯军火商维克多·布特（Viktor Bout）。 上一次类似的换囚发生在2010年的维也纳。当时10名在美国被捕的俄罗斯间谍与4名涉嫌在俄罗斯担任双重间谍的人交换。其中一人是前军事情报官员谢尔盖·斯克里帕尔（Sergei Skripa），他在2018年被毒杀于英格兰西南索尔兹伯里市（Salisbury）。 近年来莫斯科与西方的紧张局势不断升高，尤其是自2022年2月普京发动入侵乌克兰以来。 图像来源， Getty Images 2023 年 10 月在喀山被拘留的记者库尔马舍娃 (Alsu Kurmasheva) 在女儿们之间 分析：可能不会是最后一次 BBC俄罗斯事务编辑史蒂夫·罗森伯格（Steve Rosenberg） 这是自冷战以来最大规模的东西方囚犯交换。西方政府将欢迎国人获释，以及俄罗斯一些最著名的政治犯获得自由。莫斯科则将庆祝其特工的归来。 双方都会声称这是一笔好交易。 但如果俄罗斯像过去一样认定“人质外交”可行，令人担忧的是这种利用囚犯作为筹码的做法可能不会是最后一次。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69236684",
    "description": "黄思琪（Kelly Ng） BBC记者 35 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 汤慕涵是征战巴黎奥运会的中国队31名游泳选手之一。 世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）表示，由于中美两国的地缘政治紧张局势蔓延到奥运会舞台，该机构被“不公平地卷入”中美之间的争执中。 在遭遇一系列兴奋剂指控之后，中国的顶尖游泳运动员被置于聚光灯下，随后美国声称世界反兴奋剂机构掩盖此事，这引起了争议。 前往巴黎参赛的中国游泳运动员接受药检的次数是一些其他国家选手的两倍，这反过来又引发了对中国运动员受到阴谋干扰的指控。 世界反兴奋剂机构在周二的声明中说，它被卷入了“超级大国之间的地缘政治紧张局势，但却只能置身事外”。 “（美国）某些人纯粹是想通过这些涉事运动员是中国人来捞取政治筹码。”世界反兴奋剂机构媒体关系总监詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James Fitzgerald）对BBC说。“结果是，这在反兴奋剂系统内部造成了不信任和分裂。” 贸易战、地缘政治对抗以及北京与俄罗斯的友好关系已经使中美这两大经济体的关系恶化。 在竞技体育中出现这样的紧张情势并不奇怪，但现在它们似乎正在引发一场更强硬和严厉的对立。 上周，世界反兴奋剂机构表示，它正在考虑就“诽谤性”指控对美国反兴奋剂机构（USADA）采取法律行动。 后者指责世界反兴奋剂机构和中国反兴奋剂中心（Chinada）是“掩盖阳性检测结果和压制勇敢举报人声音的黑手”之一。 美国议员也指责世界反兴奋剂机构未能妥善调查针对中国游泳运动员的兴奋剂指控。本周二，他们提出了一项法案，赋予白宫削减该机构资金的权力。 “当国会议员和参议员们把自己融入反兴奋剂这个技术性很强的领域时，这就不再是科学和法律分析的问题，而是滑向了政治领域。”菲茨杰拉德说。 受污染食品和营养补充剂 在世界反兴奋剂机构周二发表声明之前，《纽约时报》报道了一起此前未公开的案件，涉及两名中国游泳运动员，其中包括一名今年的奥运代表队成员，他们因涉嫌服用兴奋剂而受到调查。 他们在2022年被检测出体内一种禁用类固醇呈阳性，但他们被允许参加比赛。中国反兴奋剂中心的结论是，这两名运动员很可能是在食用受污染的汉堡时，在不知情的情况下摄入了类固醇。 美国反兴奋剂机构指责世界反兴奋剂机构让中国“在一套不同的规则下比赛，使赛场向他们倾斜”。 但世界反兴奋剂机构为这一说法进行了辩护。该机构称，运动员的营养补充剂和毛发检测结果均为阴性，两名游泳运动员在一次检测呈阳性前后几天提供的对照样本也均为阴性。 它补充说，这两名游泳运动员被禁赛一年多，然后便结案了。 该机构说，他们的案件是“涉及来自不同运动项目的（中国）运动员的一系列更广泛案例”的一部分，并补充称，“根据案例数量，显然在全球多个国家都存在污染问题”。 在6月的一份声明中，世界反兴奋剂机构指出，吃肉的运动员如果摄入了瘦肉精，有时会出现药检呈阳性的情况。瘦肉精是一种被禁用的物质，被用作家畜的生长促进剂。 在回答《纽约时报》的问题时，该机构表示正在调查中国以及墨西哥、危地马拉和其他国家的污染事件。 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 巴黎奥运会开幕式如何与众不同？这些是目前已知的要点 巴黎奥运：从性别平等、独特开幕式到俄罗斯运动员，你可能忽略的一些重要细节 图像来源， Getty Images 美国官员指责世界反兴奋剂机构“不公平地”偏袒中国游泳运动员。 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” 该机构的负责人奥利维尔·尼格里（Olivier Niggli）当时指出，美国媒体“只问有关中国的问题，而肉类污染在许多国家都是个问题”，并提到“有人试图将反兴奋剂政治化”。 今年4月，《纽约时报》报道称，在2021年东京奥运会前几个月，23名中国游泳运动员在被检测是否服用提高成绩的药物时呈阳性，这掀起了轩然大波。 但在中国官员发现药检结果是由污染造成后，他们获准参赛。这支30人的队伍在东京奥运会上赢得了六枚奖牌，包括三枚金牌。其中11名药检呈阳性的运动员还被选入出征巴黎奥运会的中国游泳队。 美国游泳运动员、11枚奥运奖牌得主凯蒂·莱德基（Katie Ledecky）曾表示，在23名中国游泳运动员药检阳性的消息传出后，她对反兴奋剂监管机构的信心降到了“历史最低点”。 然而，世界反兴奋剂机构的调查发现，它“无法否认污染的可能性”是这种治疗心脏病的药物曲美他嗪（TMZ）的来源。 该机构表示，有鉴于受检运动员中，“曲美他嗪的浓度一直很低，且没有服用兴奋剂的模式”，这些因素都支持了污染的可能性。也就是说，运动员们几天的测试结果不一致，在阴性和阳性之间摇摆。 一项独立调查发现，世界反兴奋剂机构没有处理不当，也没有对中国游泳运动员表现出偏向性。 美中巨头间的冲突 这些丑闻加大了反兴奋剂官员的压力，当中国游泳队抵达巴黎时，他们接受的药检远远超过了标准。 据负责监管水上运动的世界泳联（World Aquatics）称，自今年1月以来，中国游泳队的31名队员平均每人接受了21次不同反兴奋剂组织的药检。 相比之下，澳大利亚的41名游泳运动员平均接受了4次药检，美国的46名游泳运动员平均接受了6次药检。 这一系列检测引发了另一系列指控。中国官方报纸《环球时报》指责西方大国“滥用兴奋剂检测扰乱中国游泳队”。 图像来源， Getty Images 张雨霏在100米蝶泳比赛中获得铜牌。 上海一位国际政治学教授在接受《环球时报》采访时，指责美国主导了反兴奋剂规则。 沈毅称，“苛刻和不道德的检测”扰乱了中国队的训练，并称这是“奥运会的耻辱”。 保持着男子200米蛙泳世界纪录的中国游泳选手覃海洋说，这些药检表明“近几年中国游泳队的成绩让欧美强队感受到了威胁”。 “一些小把戏意图扰乱我们的备战节奏，摧毁我们的心理防线。但我们不会惧怕。”他在中国社交媒体平台微博上说。 覃海洋曾在去年的世锦赛上夺得50米、100米和200米蛙泳金牌，他在周日的男子100米蛙泳决赛中获得第七名。 中国前跳水冠军高敏也提出了同样的批评。她说，苛刻的测试“干扰了我们中国游泳队”，并称覃海洋的表现是“这两年所有比赛中最差的一次”。 中国目前的奖牌总数为一金两银两铜。 中国的“蝶后”张雨霏在东京奥运会上获得了100米蝶泳银牌。在周一，她为自己获得铜牌而流泪，但表示兴奋剂检测对她没有太大影响。 她说，虽然兴奋剂检测是“有点烦躁”，但更多的是“远远大于”想象的压力。 梁艳婷（Annabelle Liang）补充报道。",

    "title": "上半年经济形势堪忧 中共政治局会议传递了哪些信息",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-69234753",
    "description": "21 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 7月30日举行中共政治局会议主题是“分析研究当前经济形势，部署下半年经济工作”，中共高层表示要“坚定不移完成全年经济社会发展目标任务”。 对于中国经济而言，亟待回答的问题是，能否完成“5%左右”的全年经济增长目标？ 今年一季度，中国经济增长势头不错，GDP增速5.3%；第二季度却大幅低于各机构预测，仅为4.7%，使得上半年整体经济增速为5%，与全年目标持平。 专家表示 ，今年下半年的基数效应将有所减弱，使得通往5%的道路充满挑战，如果要实现这一目标，可能需要看到进一步的政策支持。 GDP增速是基于去年同期经济数据计算的增长速率，去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 分析指出，这次政治局会议传递出的四个发力方向能否兑现，还需要进一步观察。 中国到底有没有“产能过剩”？为何事关欧美？ 欧盟打了中国最疼爱的“孩子”：对华电动车关税落地 最高48.1% 二十届三中全会：300多项改革出台 2029年中国人的生活将是什么样？ 宏观政策：刺激可能加力 宏观政策，通常指各国政府通过“货币政策”或“财政政策”来调节经济，通俗而言，就是“印钱”和“撒钱”。 对比4月30日的政治局会议，对下阶段宏观政策的表述明显不同：上次会议称“要靠前发力有效落实已经确定的宏观政策”；这次会议称“宏观政策要持续用力、更加给力”、“要加强逆周期调节”、“加大宏观调控力度”等。 安邦智库分析称，上次会议到这次会议之间，中国的宏观政策均处于观望期。这是因为此前美国尚未传递出明显的降息信号，中国降息空间没有打开。 但这一形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，中国需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安邦智库认为，会议字里行间的表述意味着下半年积极的财政政策将通过发行更多的国债和地方债来完成，而在“防风险”和“稳增长”之间，财政政策真正能够“加力”的空间，仍需要依靠发行特别国债等“国债财政”来实现。 “外部压力的增加，包括特朗普的潜在回归，凸显了刺激国内经济的紧迫性。”经济学人智库（EIU）首席中国经济学家苏月向BBC中文表示，假定其它因素保持不变，特朗普上台后如果中国对美出口额外增加 10%的关税，会使中国2025和2026年的GDP 增长率平均下降0.3-0.4个百分点。那么更果断的国内政策和财政扩张才可减轻部分影响。 图像来源， Getty Image 中国经济形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安抚民营企业 2020年底，习近平在一次企业家座谈会上提到“弘扬企业家精神”。但之后新冠疫情中实施的严厉封控，以及政府先后对对房地产、互联网、教培等行业的强力监管，让很多民营企业的日子不好过，信心严重受损。 今年7月15日的二十届三中全会的文件中再次出现“企业家精神”，本次政治局会议则试图强调民营企业的重要性： 比如，防止和纠正一些地方利用行政、刑事手段干预经济纠纷；要有力有效支持发展瞪羚企业、独角兽企业；要弘扬企业家精神，在改革创新和公平竞争中加快建设更多世界一流企业。 苏月解释称，会议特别关注民营企业、高增长企业和独角兽企业，并再次强调保护产权。会议没有过多提及国有企业，这表明下半年的重点将放在民营企业上。 “会议旨在通过提出切实可行的改革措施，解决以往政策执行不力的问题。会议还强调要遏制地方政府利用行政和刑事手段干预经济纠纷，完善市场机制。”苏月预计，这些政策方向将对信心产生“轻微的积极影响”。 首提防“内卷式”恶性竞争 图像来源， Getty Image 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”一词，而防“内卷式恶性竞争”首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中。 “内卷式”恶性竞争首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中——“要强化行业自律”，“强化市场优胜劣汰机制，畅通落后低效产能退出渠道”。 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”来形容这一问题。 苏月称，“内卷式”恶性竞争的提法可以理解为官方对产能过剩问题的回应，有助于缓解贸易压力。 在今年4月之前，对“产能过剩”的讨论和担忧，广泛存在于中国自己的官方语境和媒体舆论中。 比如，去年年底召开的中央经济工作会议指出，进一步推动经济回升向好需要克服一些困难和挑战，其中即包括“部分行业产能过剩”。今年3月的“两会”上，政府工作报告对此予以重申。 而上一次“产能过剩”出现在中央经济工作会议上，还是五年前。 2023年末，中国汽车制造、计算机通信电子、纺织业、食品制造业、医药制造业和电气机械等行业的产能利用率，甚至低于2016年末。 到今年4月，“产能过剩”突然成为中国对外贸易的热词——4日到9日，美国财长耶伦访华，点名了三个中国的产业产能过剩，可能会伤害美国；16日，德国总理朔尔茨访华，再提对“产能过剩”的关切。到了7月，欧盟对中国电动车加征额外的关税。 此后，中国避免使用“产能过剩”来描述供给侧的问题，而开始强调防“内卷式”恶性竞争。 “这与此前电池、光伏退出落后产能的相关政策一脉相承，也是从中央层面上明确定调要实施供给侧改革。”安邦智库表示，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争，例如新能源车、光伏、锂电池等。 “不过，实施供给侧改革政策的主要考量何在？‘内卷’行业如何自律？过剩的产能如何出清？是否会通过技术标准以行政手段强行关停一些项目？以及是否会在信贷上收紧来强制出清竞争力不足的企业？这一系列后续仍有待观察。” 图像来源， Getty Image 分析指，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争。 如何拉动消费 此次会议频繁提及增加收入、促进消费。 会议指出，“要以提振消费为重点扩大国内需求，经济政策的着力点要更多转向惠民生、促消费，要多渠道增加居民收入，增强中低收入群体的消费能力和意愿，把服务消费作为消费扩容升级的重要抓手，支持文旅、养老、育幼、家政等消费。” “中央政府非常重视保持扶贫成果，并将重点放在对低收入群体的转移支付上。”不过，苏月提醒，中等收入家庭的收入增长乏力与房地产行业的困境息息相关，这凸显了制定以家庭为重点的财政政策的必要性。 安邦智库注意到，促进消费的重点将放在以文旅、养老、育幼、家政为代表的服务消费上，实际上服务业在就业结构中占据了很大一部分，推动服务消费也可以解决就业的问题。 “但就多渠道增加居民收入而言，通过哪些渠道？如何才能让老百姓增加收入？这些并未提及。”安邦智库分析认为，在消费这个问题上，采取修修补补的设备更新和智能化改造措施是没问题的，但要真正拉动“消费—收入”的循环链条，还要回归到能否扭转市场对未来经济的预期上。",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69234346",
    "description": "28 分钟前 图像来源， EPA 哈马斯高层则表示该组织陷入了震惊状态。 伊朗指责以色列周三（7月31日）在首都德黑兰暗杀了哈马斯领导人伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚（Ismail Haniyeh）， 并威胁对以色列实施“严厉惩罚”。以色列并未直接对哈尼亚的死发表评论。 然而，以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡则称，近日他的国家对敌人“迎头重击”，在黎巴嫩击毙一名黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官。 他向色列民众表示“艰难日子即将到来”，因为中东局势正在升温，对于该区域爆发更大规模军事冲突的忧虑越来越高。“自贝鲁特行动以来， 我们听到各方的威胁，”内塔尼亚胡在电视讲话中表示。 “我们已做好准备应对任何情况，我们将团结一致、坚定不移，”他强调。 不过，联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯警告不要让局势“危险升级”。 哈尼亚被杀重创以巴停火前景。哈马斯武装部门表示，被广泛视为该组织政治领袖的哈尼亚遇刺将“战斗推向新的境界”并造成重大影响。哈马斯去年10月7日在以色列境内发动攻击造成约1200人丧生。 此后，以色列誓言摧毁哈马斯。 哈马斯称领导人哈尼亚在伊朗遇刺身亡 誓言进行报复 中国站在以色列与哈马斯面前的三个问题 一文看懂巴以冲突关键角色：哈马斯是谁？ 以巴冲突：揭开哈马斯高层人物的面纱 哈尼亚在曾在加沙停火谈判中扮演重要角色。他在周三出席伊朗新总统梅赫迪·巴哈达德·岛加德就职仪式后不久遇害。 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调，哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。当时还有3名哈马斯领导人和数名警卫与他同在这栋楼内。 哈马斯高层哈利勒·阿勒-哈亚在记者会上引述一名目击者的话称，一枚导弹直接命中了哈尼亚。 哈尼亚从20世纪80年代末开始成为哈马斯的重要成员。作为位于卡塔尔的政治局主席，他负责与地区政府的联系，也是哈马斯与德黑兰及其在中东地区的代理人组织之间的核心人物。数月来，他一直是以色列当局通缉的目标。BBC了解到，因为安全考虑，他最近一次前往黎巴嫩的行程被他的保安小组否决。 但是他很少参与哈马斯的军事行动，因此可能感到自己比一些同伙更能公开行动。这也反映在自10月7日以色列遭遇袭击事件后，他曾有过三次前往伊朗的行程。 根据报导，在哈尼亚遇袭身亡之前，关于他的继任问题已开始浮现。根据哈马斯的宪法，政治局主席最多只能连任两届，新的候选人原定于2025年选出。 图像来源， EPA 哈尼亚周二出现在伊朗议会。周三（7月31日）出席伊朗新总统就职仪式后不久遇害。 哈尼亚的去世可能会加速该组织内部的权力角力。阿拉伯外交官普遍认为，与其他哈马斯高层相比，哈尼亚是一个较为务实的人物。他主导了哈马斯与区域政府的政治接触，而非偏向军事行动。这种战略与穆罕默德·代夫等领导人的取向不同，因为后者领导着哈马斯的军事部门。就在本月初以色列声称在加沙的空袭击中了代夫，但未能证实其是否遇难。 一名哈马斯官员告诉BBC：“哈马斯是一个理念，是一种意识形态。领导人的被杀并不会改变它，亦不会让哈马斯投降或让步。” 这似乎是试图淡化组织内部可能存在的紧张局势。 此外，就在哈尼亚遭杀害前几个小时，以色列称，其已在贝鲁特击毙黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官福阿德·舒库尔（Fuad Shukur）。以色列认为，他策划了上周末对戈兰高地发动的火箭弹攻击，这次袭击造成12人死亡。但真主党否认参与其中。 但真主党的报复是很可能发生的。因为这个受伊朗支持，实力强大的组织过去曾在领导人被杀害后，向以色列发射大量火箭弹作为回应。 美国已更新了对公民的旅行指引，警告他们说，因为“局势紧张升高”，不要前往黎巴嫩。英国外交大臣也敦促本国公民离开黎巴嫩。一些国际航空公司业已取消了飞往贝鲁特之航班。预计联合航空、达美航空和英国航空也将宣布暂停飞往以色列特拉维夫的班机。 图像来源， WAEL HAMZEH/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。 分析：以色列的豪赌 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion BBC国际事务编辑杰里米·鲍文（Jeremy Bowen） 以色列给予其敌人两次重创。 虽然以色列并未承认他们在德黑兰杀害了哈马斯政治领袖伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚，但很难想到还有谁能比以色列更想要他的命。 至于黎巴嫩真主党指挥官富阿德·舒克尔，以色列则表示他在贝鲁特遭到一次“基于情报的消除行动”中丧生。 对以色列而言，哈马斯内部任何大人物都是他们猎杀的目标。因为去年10月7日哈马斯的攻击造成了自1948年以来以色列最惨重的单日伤亡。 以色列表示，杀害舒克尔是因为这位资深的真主党指挥官，要为导致12名儿童和年轻人在以色列占领的戈兰高地丧生的火箭弹攻击负责。 真主党确认舒克尔在贝鲁特的突袭行动中丧命，但他们否认发动了在戈兰高地的攻击。 无论如何，中东再次充斥着自去年10月7日以来，即将到来的全面战争的恐怖猜测。而且，残酷且讽刺的一点在于双方都不希望爆发这场战争，但却越来越准备冒险。 以色列一直受到美国盟友的压力，要求他们对真主党的报复保持克制，并在不引发毁灭性报复和引发更大规模战争的情况下去打击真主党。 但这两次暗杀行动等同于一次巨大的赌博。 压力下，以色列希望对真主党造成打击但不引发毁灭性报复。但真主党领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉仍可能作出这样的决定：因为以色列对他们在贝鲁特南部的大本营发动攻击，真主党就应该对特拉维夫进行同样力度的回击。 以色列可能也已经评估过，在伊朗境内及层层保护下杀害了这名巴勒斯坦领导人，德黑兰也不会对其宣战。 哈尼亚刚会见了伊朗新任总统就丢了性命，这无疑是以色列战力的一次戏剧性展示。 伊朗伊斯兰共和国称，在今年4月对以色列发射数百枚导弹和无人机后已重建了抵御敌军的战力，但这一说法现已被证实是空洞的。当时发动的炮击是报复以色列之前空袭了位于大马士革的伊朗大使馆并杀害了2名伊朗将军。 现在看来伊朗、其盟友黎巴嫩真主党或其代理人很可能会再次进行报复。亲伊朗的伊拉克民兵已明确表示，针对暗杀事件，他们也指责并要求华盛顿负责。在红海地区，也许也会看到胡塞武装分子从也门（叶门）加大对以色列的攻击。 因为数月来来在加沙地带遭受以色列猛攻，哈马斯反击能力有限。而以色列对在其占领的西岸或在国内遭受攻击的可能性都有高度警惕。 众人必须认知到，中东地区已陷入了一场区域性战争，而且情况可能会变得更加糟。在这个世界上最动荡地区，战争的风险即严峻又清晰可见，我们很容易想像并构建各种战争情景。但即便如此，这一轮杀戮和报复也未必会引发全面战争。 一次又一次化解，无法减少全面战争的可能性。这也使得建立一条远离全面冲突威胁的外交途径变得更加困难。 如何降低中东致命高温？唯一有效的第一步就是加沙停火。",

    "description": "艾奥内·威尔斯（Ione Wells）&amp; 凡妮莎·布施施吕特（Vanessa Buschschlüter） BBC记者 发自加拉加斯和伦敦 11 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 在南美国家委内瑞拉总统选举的争议“结果揭晓”后，首都加拉加斯街头爆发了新一轮的示威。 数千人聚集在委内瑞拉首都市中心，抗议现任总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicolas Maduro）宣称拿下胜利。 许多人认为，他们不会停止抗议，直到出现新政府。有些人还说，只有当国家安全部队加入反对派示威，新政府才会出现。 但是该国军队和警察到目前为止仍然忠诚于马杜罗，并开始对一些抗议者发射催泪瓦斯和橡胶子弹。 委内瑞拉地方官员称约有750人被逮捕。该国两家主要的非政府组织表示，至今已有数名民众死亡，数十人受伤。 周二（7月30日），委内瑞拉国防部长将抗议活动称为是一场“政变”。 被武装部队的保护下，弗拉基米尔·帕德里诺（Vladimir Padrino）将军宣读了一份声明称，马杜罗总统拥有军队的“绝对忠诚和无条件的支持。” 此外，马杜罗的亲密盟友、委内瑞拉检察长说，在反政府抗议活动中一名士兵已被杀害。 委内瑞拉：中俄印六大国选边站队各有考量 委内瑞拉危机：伊朗油轮与美国军舰或在海上对峙 中国向委内瑞拉再伸援手 习近平马杜罗各有所图 委内瑞拉危机：七张图帮你梳理头绪 图像来源， Getty Images 示威者向BBC强调他们发现大选舞弊证。 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多（Maria Corina Machado）呼吁抗议活动保持和平。她说：“我们必须以和平的方式行事。我们不应陷入政府设下的挑衅陷阱。他们想让委内瑞拉人彼此对抗。” “我们的候选人赢得了70%的选票。我们团结了一个国家，曾经相信马杜罗的委内瑞拉人今天过来与我们站在一起了。” 害怕遭到安全部队报复而不愿具名的一名示威者向BBC强调，他们发现了大选舞弊证据。 他说：“我们绝对确定选举被偷走了。我在投票站工作。政府不承认这一点，他们在半夜停止了所有投票计票。他们不想让世界知道他们输了。” 示威者又解释，过去支持前领导人查韦斯（Hugo Chavez）的委内瑞拉公民，即所谓的“查维斯主义者”（Chavistas）现正在收回对现任总统马杜罗的支持。 “这是一个非常和平的抗议活动。这是加拉加斯的富人区。但我们昨天看到的情况相当暴力。我相信以前是查维斯主义者的人现在已不再是了。”示威者说。 “我认为人们都希望有所改变。情况很可能会演变成暴力冲突。” 图像来源， Reuters 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多呼吁和平示威。 抗议活动在该国全国选举委员会（CNE）主席宣布马杜罗“成功连任”第三届总统任期后爆发。这位主席是马杜罗所属政党的成员，也曾是后者的法律顾问。 委内瑞拉全国选举委员会此前宣布马杜罗以51%的得票率当选，领先于反对派埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯 （Edmundo González）的44%。 但委内瑞拉选举机构至今未公布详细的投票统计数据。因此，反对派认为大选结果存在舞弊。 美洲国家组织（OAS）指责委内瑞拉政府完全扭曲了选举结果。支持贡萨雷斯的反对派联盟说，他们已经审查了73.2%的投票统计数据，坚持认为贡萨雷斯以很大优势胜出。 图像来源， Reuters 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机的母国 “我们有记录显示我们的胜利是绝对的，在数学上是无可逆转的胜利。”贡萨雷斯对外强调。然而本周委内瑞拉全国选举委员会仍宣称所有票数均已统计完毕，结果是现任总统胜出。 此外，长期支持马杜罗的检察长塔雷克·萨布（Tarek Saab）警告称，被捕者将被指控“颠覆政府”，并且在最严重的情况下将会涉嫌“恐怖主义”。 委内瑞拉反对党“人民意志”（Popular Will）强调，现在被拘留的包括该党的全国政治协调员佛莱迪·苏帕拉诺（Freddy Superlano）。 该党又警告称，执政党政府正加强力度镇压要求政府公布投票数据的人士。 图像来源， Reuters 马杜罗的支持者也走上街头，坚称他赢得了公平的胜利。 住在佩特雷市（Patera）的朱利奥·德比斯（Julio Derbis）向BBC强调：“我们将战斗下去。我们希望通过街头压力能够推翻总统想要继续掌权的企图。” “警察是我们的邻居。我们生活在一起，他们需要明白需要加入争取所有人共同利益的战斗。” 另一名示威者卡里娜·平托（Karina Pinto）向BBC解释此次抗议与之前的反政府示威不同。 她说：“我们必须走上街头，因为这是唯一的方式。我们不支持暴力，但政府很暴力。我们必须作出回应。 “安全部队必须站在我们这一边，他们也是委内瑞拉人。他们不能反对我们，因为我们跟她们一样都是人民。” 不过在该市内另一个区域，马杜罗总统的支持者也聚集在街头，坚称他公平获胜。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 一名支持者南希·拉蒙斯（Nancy Ramones）说：“我没有在抗议任何事情，我在支持我的政府，就是那个获胜的政府。尼古拉斯·马杜罗总统。我支持他，因为他是代表和平的人。” “反对派说的那些都没有证据。如果他们说选举存在舞弊就必须证明。事实上没有发生任何舞弊。反对派总是有一些隐藏的政治目的。” “这是我们不会允许的政变，因为我们是爱国者。我们是委内瑞拉人，我们热爱和平。”拉蒙斯说。 另一位民众米拉格罗斯·亚罗查（Milagros Arocha）向BBC强调：“在这里，真正获胜的是尼古拉斯·马杜罗。这里是代表尼古拉斯·马杜罗的人。我们要和平。” 在普遍的不满情绪中，委内瑞拉反对党已经团结一致支持贡萨雷斯参选，试图在马杜罗执政11年之后推翻他的政府。 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机困扰的委内瑞拉。 联合国人权事务高级专员沃可·特尔克（Volker Turk）表示，他对委内瑞拉日益紧张和暴力的局势深感担忧。他呼吁当局尊重所有委内瑞拉人和平集会和抗议的权利。",

    "description": "彼得·鲍尔（Peter Ball）和劳拉·加西亚（Laura Garcia） BBC国际部记者，巴黎报道 14 分钟前 桥下走道上摆放着棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 2024年奥运会的目标不仅是一场体育盛会，也是主办城市巴黎的可持续发展和复兴。但该计划受到活动人士的质疑，他们声称当局一直在强迫脆弱的移民和无家可归者离开街道，并将他们驱散到法国各地。 在巴黎一座横跨运河的桥下，坐落着数十个巨大而棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 活动人士表示，这些石块的用途是在2024年奥运会期间，让流浪者和移民远离街头。 法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”（Paris Solidarity Bar）的奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）说：“今天，街上再也没有人了。” “你可以看到桥下的这些石块。”她指着一片片混凝土块补充道。“警察会来巡逻，以免移民们回来重新搭建营地。” 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）为法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”工作。 大约在奥运会开幕式前一周，一群流浪者从这里搬走。这是奥运会开幕前几个月当局清理的一长串据点和营地中最新的一处。 法雷斯·阿尔卡利·优素福（Faris Al Khali Youssouf）就是受影响者之一。他是一名来自乍得的移民，他和其他大约500人住在离奥运村只有几百米远的一栋建筑里，该建筑曾经属于一家混凝土工厂。 今年4月，防暴警察对这栋楼进行了清场，居民们被告知，他们将被安排在巴黎地区或数百公里外的图卢兹市暂住。 “你不得不说，这对难民来说简直就是一场噩梦。”法雷斯说。 “这是我们所有同胞目前都在经历的事情——他们在购买地铁票时被拦下，被截住并被转移到拘留中心。” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” “难民正面临压力。” 从部署混凝土块的地方沿着运河步行几分钟后，活动人士保罗·阿劳兹（Paul Alauzy）在不同的桥下描述了另一次清场的过程。 “这里曾经有好几年都是帐篷城，有三年都有人在这里。”他指着人们曾经扎营的柱子之间的缝隙说。“到处都是帐篷，有时有100、200或300人。” 保罗为“奖牌的另一面”（Le Revers de la Médaille）组织工作。他称，在奥运会筹备期间，约有1.3万名移民离开了巴黎街头。 这是一项长期战略的一部分，活动人士认为，随着奥运会的临近，这项战略正在加速推进。 优素福表示，他在非洲国家乍得受到政治迫害后逃亡到法国。 当局已经为迁离街头的人们提供了住所，但这些住所往往是临时性的，而且远离巴黎，分布在法国各地的不同城市。 “当你把巴黎街头的人们送到很远的小城市时，他们就没有了同样的团结网络。”保罗说。 “当然，我们不希望人们呆在外面，我们希望他们有地方住。”他补充说。 “但如果你像这样驱散，而不提供长期的解决方案，你将永远无法解决问题。” 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎警察清理了优素福曾经居住过的占屋区。 他说，在巴黎为移民群体开发的大型社区之外，人们很难获得所需的支持和医疗服务，最终只能搬回首都，重新流落街头。 在之前的奥运会上也有类似的抱怨。在东京，流浪者群体抱怨说，他们被迫离开曾经露宿的公园；在里约热内卢，整个贫民窟棚户区都被清空了。 然而，巴黎当局坚持认为，让人们离开街头是改善他们生活的关键。 图像来源， Getty Images 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望——这也是我们正在与国家讨论的议题之一——能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 “据我所知，在现阶段，阻碍事情发展的是国家可以分配的财政资源。” 巴黎市政厅对BBC表示，“流浪者问题是奥运筹备工作的核心，在奥运会期间，巴黎市政厅将继续保持警惕，为弱势人群提供住宿。” 该部门还补充说：“巴黎市政府不会运用对流浪者有敌意的城市设施”。 该部门说，放置在桥下的混凝土块并不在巴黎市的土地上，而是属于邻近的卫星城欧贝维利耶（Aubervilliers）。欧贝维利耶市政当局表示，其正在使用“劝阻性”的街道设施，以防止“移民和吸毒者”回流。 活动人士保罗·阿劳齐讲述桥下移民营地如何被当局清理掉。 不过，许多活动人士仍对此深表担忧。 “对我来说，简而言之，这就是一场社会清理。”保罗说。 “你把人们赶出去，防止他们再回来，你只是把苦痛藏在地毯下，因为这只是短期的解决方案。”",

    "description": "25 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 本周一，习近平与梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆举行了会谈。 7月27日至31日，意大利总理乔治亚·梅洛尼（Giorgia Meloni）对中国进行正式访问，访问期间，她会见了中国权力排名最高的三个领导人：国家主席习近平、总理李强、人大委员长赵乐际。 在会见习近平时她表示，中国是应对全球紧张局势的“重要对话者”；会见李强后，签署了一项加强经济合作的三年行动计划。 梅洛尼是意大利右翼政治家，2022年执政后退出习近平的标志性对外政策“一带一路”倡议，此前意大利是唯一加入该倡议的G7国家。 2022年11月，梅洛尼与习近平在巴厘岛G20峰会期间进行了双边会谈；此次是她上任后首次访华。梅洛尼称，此行为了“重启”意大利与中国的关系。 做了什么，说了什么 梅洛尼带着自己8岁的女儿抵达北京开启访华行程。 上周日她与中国国务院总理李强会面，梅洛尼表示，“我很高兴来这里展开本届政府的首次正式访问，在此之前，我们已经举行了数次高级别会议，这表明了我们开启新阶段的意愿，在我们全球战略伙伴关系建立20周年之际，重新启动我们的双边合作。” 会谈后，在梅洛尼和李强的见证下，中意两国签署三年行动计划，梅洛尼称其为“尝试新的合作形式”。 北京方面声明称，此举旨在增加两国在中小型企业在造船、航空航天、新能源、人工智能等领域的互利合作。 周日晚些时候，梅洛尼和李强出席了中意商业论坛，并在论坛上宣布了六项新协议，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源等不同领域。 梅洛尼在论坛上说，意大利与中国签署了一份工业合作备忘录，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源领域，这些是“中国已经运作了一段时间的前沿技术行业……（中国）正与合作伙伴分享新的前沿知识”。 一带一路：G7唯一参与国意大利正式退出 意大利大选极右翼政党获胜 有望诞生首位女总理 “一带一路”倡议十周年 改变世界的成败与未来 图像来源， Getty Image 两国领导人会谈。 本周一，梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆与习近平会谈，她表示，“国际上不安全因素日益增多，我认为中国不可避免地成为应对所有这些情况的一个非常重要的对话者。 她说，两国必须 “共同思考”，以保持稳定和保障和平。 意大利总理办公室其后发布声明称，两国领导人讨论的问题包括乌克兰战争、中东局势进一步升级的风险以及印度洋-太平洋地区日益加剧的紧张局势，以及“从人工智能到应对气候变化和联合国安理会改革”等一些最重要的全球治理问题。 习近平则敦促罗马和北京“秉持丝绸之路精神”，使东西方关系“重回新时代”。 他说，“双方都面临着共同发展的重要机遇”，并补充说，“北京欢迎意大利企业来华投资，也愿意进口更多高质量的意大利产品”。 意大利通讯社（ANSA）报道称，习近平还表示中国有意与意大利探索在电动汽车和人工智能等新兴领域的合作。意大利是中国在欧盟的第四大贸易伙伴，该国因此仍热衷于寻求与北京建立强有力的经济关系。 在梅洛尼访问期间，两国还共同纪念意大利探险家马可·波罗逝世700周年。 值得一提的是，梅洛尼还在上述商业论坛上说：“中国在意大利的投资约为意大利在中国投资的三分之一。我希望以正确的方式缩小这一差距”。除了投资外，贸易也不平衡，去年双边贸易额达717.58亿美元，其中主要是中国对意大利的出口。 尴尬的前奏 梅洛尼访华过程中，中意双方在公开讲话和声明中，绝口不提“一带一路”倡议。只有习近平在会谈时表示，“中国和意大利分处古丝绸之路两端”，“弘扬丝路精神”，但未直接谈及中国雄心勃勃的“一带一路”倡议。 2019年，意大利成为第一个签署“一带一路”倡议的七国集团国家，这引起了美国和其他欧洲国家的担忧，认为这可能导致中国控制关键技术和基础设施。 然而，彼时在野的梅洛尼长期以来一直对“一带一路”倡议持批评态度，梅洛尼称其为 “一个大错误”。2022年梅洛尼上台，2023年12月正式通知中国政府将于年底退出该倡议。 投资银行“那提西银行”（Natixis）亚太区首席经济学家阿莉西亚·加西亚·埃雷罗（Alicia Garcia-Herrero）向媒体表示，“每个加入（一带一路倡议）的国家都知道，中国是第一位的，而他们是第二位的，我不认为意大利作为七国集团（G7）成员希望与俄罗斯、巴基斯坦或斯里兰卡被归为一类。” 她补充说：“如果没有‘一带一路倡议’（成员资格），梅洛尼与中国的接触就会处于不同的层次——不再是附庸，而是合作伙伴。” 不过，当时许多意大利公司担心中国政府可能会采取报复行动，影响它们在中国的投资或者与中国的贸易。 不仅如此，梅洛尼上台后还阻止一家中国国有企业控制轮胎制造巨头倍耐力（Pirelli）。 图像来源， Getty Images 中国的国有化工巨头中化集团是倍耐力的最大股东，持有这家拥有151年历史的米兰公司37%的股份。 去年六月，倍耐力在一份致投资者的声明中对外表示，意大利政府已裁定，只有倍耐力老板马尔科·特隆切蒂·普罗维拉（Marco Tronchetti Provera）控制的卡姆芬公司（Camfin）才能提名首席执行官候选人。 倍耐力还表示，政府已决定，该公司针对公司治理的任何变化都应接受官方审查。 在最近中国和欧盟的贸易摩擦中，意大利也支持欧盟委员会提高对中国进口电动车关税的决策。 早在2008年，梅洛尼作为已故总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼（Silvio Berlusconi）政府的青年部长，她曾敦促意大利运动员抵制2008年北京奥运会开幕式，以抗议中国的人权记录，尤其是在西藏的人权问题。 外界认为，这些都成为与中国改善关系过程中的阻碍。 重启之路 但中国有可能不计前嫌，跟意大利修补关系——路透社表示，意大利对中国具有重要的战略意义，因为该国以前曾独自与中国进行过合作，并可能成为欧盟、G7等集团内部一个对华温和的声音。 曾倡导罗马在2019年加入“一带一路”倡议的意大利前政府官员米歇尔·杰拉奇（Michele Geraci）说，中国政府可能也会渴望摆脱最近的挫折。 “中国的目标是假装一切顺利，&quot;他说。“他们对强调意大利退出‘一带一路’倡议并无太大兴趣。他们不喜欢这样，不喜欢大惊小怪。” 图像来源， Getty Image 中意两国国旗 梅洛尼的公开发言似乎表明，意大利也有意向中国靠拢，并成为中国在欧盟中的朋友之一。梅洛尼称，“我认为，意大利也可以在（中国）与欧盟的关系中发挥重要作用，并在此尝试建立尽可能平衡的贸易关系。” 路透社表示，虽然意大利去年迫于美国压力最终退出“一带一路”，但罗马在周日签署了一项为期三年的行动计划，表明它仍希望与这个亚洲巨人建立更牢固的贸易关系。 中国国际问题研究院欧洲研究所所长崔洪建说，面对地缘政治的不确定性，包括美国大选带来的不确定性，中国的首要任务是稳定两国关系。中方告诉意方“我们需要在两国关系中增加一些韧性”。 但这并不意味着重启关系之路会一帆风顺。梅洛尼本人一直对中国持警惕态度，对中国的人权问题直言不讳，还指责中国的不公平贸易行为，并警告欧洲在战略供应链中过度依赖中国公司可能带来风险。 即便是气氛颇为友好的访华之旅期间，她在上述商业论坛上，对企业高管们说，“显然，我们不能掩盖严重失衡的问题，这对意大利来说是一个重要的逆差”，并提到了改善中国市场准入和加强知识产权保护的必要性。 李强在会面时也表示，“希望欧盟客观看待中国的发展......深化对话与合作”，“保护主义无法保护竞争力”。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/sports-69230112",
    "description": "詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James FitzGerald） 巴黎报道 1 小时前 图像来源， EPA 这本该是2024年巴黎奥运会的一大亮点：铁人三项运动员在塞纳河中竞逐，让游泳回归巴黎市中心。但出于对水质的担忧，首场比赛不得不推迟一天进行。 我们来到原计划起点稍下游的荣军院桥（Pont des Invalides）上，当地人和游客向我谈起他们是否想亲自下水游泳。 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 “这是一条美丽的河流。”在七月的炎热日子里，巴黎人赫达（Reda）看着塞纳河波光粼粼的水面说道。 “但我永远不会潜入水中，即便他们清理了很多年。” 塞纳河已经在本届奥运会中成为主角。在上周五晚淅淅沥沥的雨中举行的开幕式上，塞纳河接待了数以千计参加游船巡游的运动员。 一个世纪以来，由于水质问题，当局一直禁止市民在塞纳河中游泳。但通过一项大型改造项目，在塞纳河里畅游将成为本届奥运会的重要遗产之一。 就在本周一，组织者还表示他们有信心铁人三项比赛将按计划进行。但周末的大雨使这一计划落空。 巴黎的“单一系统”排水设施已经饱和，来自厨房、厕所和街道上的雨水等额外水源被排入河中。 巴黎人赫达说自己永远不会潜入塞纳河水中。 巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）最近在塞纳河中游泳，以强调为清洁塞纳河所做的努力。 此前的检测结果显示，塞纳河中的大肠杆菌水平超过了体育协会规定的上限。这种细菌可导致呕吐和腹泻等疾病。 BBC记者休·肖菲尔德（Hugh Schofield）当时也加入了伊达尔戈的行列。他不小心吞下一口河水，但他说水的味道还不错。 我在荣军院桥上与许多游客交谈时，他们都说在本国露天水域游泳并非难事。 来自英国、德国、荷兰和捷克的游客都表示，他们曾在本国的河流、湖泊和运河中游泳，如果有证据表明塞纳河是安全的，他们也会这么做。 埃斯米（右）表示，这条河看上去“没有那么糟糕”。 “我愿意试试。”来自荷兰的女士埃斯米（Esmee）说，“从这里看并没有那么糟糕。” 法国在优质浴场水质方面落后于欧盟平均水平。根据欧洲环境署（European Environment Agency）的数据，2023年约有75%的法国浴场水质被评为优，而整个欧盟的这一比例为85%。 该机构在今年5月发布的报告中指出，虽然在欧盟的大多数浴场游泳都是安全的，但沿海水域的游泳条件普遍优于河流和湖泊。 塞浦路斯以97.6%的浴场水质优良率位居榜首，其次是奥地利的96.9%和克罗地亚的96.7%。 由于该数据只针对欧盟国家，因此不包括英国。尽管塞纳河已开始允许游泳，但目前英国只有泰晤士河的一个河段——牛津郡瓦灵福德附近——被指定为游泳场所。 欧洲环境署特别提到了巴黎10年前开始的耗资14亿欧元（11亿英镑；15 亿美元）的清理行动。 作为这项行动的一部分，巴黎建造了一个巨大的雨水蓄集池。它可以储存相当于20个奥林匹克游泳池的水量。这是阻止污水在暴雨期间流入塞纳河的机制的一部分。 丹妮勒表示，她期待着在这条著名的河流中畅游。 在男子铁人三项比赛前夕，并非所有来到大桥的游客都对清洁问题感到困扰。一些人表示，只要天气足够暖和，无论如何他们都会考虑跳进河里。 一位来自巴西的男子说，他和他的同胞就是这么做的。他承认：“在我的城市圣保罗，河水也不干净。” 但许多巴黎人都认为，一条干净、适于游泳的河流将成为奥运遗产中令人兴奋的一部分。 大学教授丹妮勒（Danielle）说，她“绝对会”在塞纳河中游泳。 “我早就想这么做了。”她笑着说。 对于一个名叫达米安（Damien）的男子来说，保持塞纳河的清洁是一项“大工程”，但值得一做。 “这对所有巴黎人来说都是一个好机会。”他说。 目前，塞纳河的水质每天都会被进行检测。 2024年巴黎奥运会运营总监兰比斯·康斯坦丁尼蒂斯（Lambis Konstantinidis）说，目前有若干备用计划，包括使用补赛日。 他在星期一对BBC说，只有在“非常、非常极端的情况下”，才会考虑将铁人三项赛降级为铁人二项，并完全取消游泳比赛。 劳伦·特纳（Lauren Turner）补充报道",

    "description": "EPA bids to change chemical risk evaluations, which could expose public to higher levels of PFAS and other pollutants The Trump administration is quietly carrying out a plan that aims to kill hundreds of bans on highly toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” and other dangerous compounds in consumer goods. The bans, largely at the state level , touch most facets of daily life, prohibiting everything from bisphenol in children’s products to mercury in personal care products to PFAS in food packaging and clothing .

    "description": "Rather than an explosive split that many predicted, Musk instead appears set to keep close ties with Trump and retain influence on US politics After months of exerting extraordinary power over the US government and becoming a mascot for Donald Trump’s new administration , the first signs that Elon Musk may shift away from his prominent role in the White House began to appear this week. Both Trump and JD Vance have stated in interviews over the past few days that Musk would eventually leave the administration and the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) that he founded, their most direct statements yet on his tenure. Politico also reported on Wednesday that Trump had told members of his inner circle that the Tesla CEO would be departing in the coming weeks, though Musk called the article “fake news”. Musk is a “special government employee”, a designation that technically carries a 130-day term that, depending on how the administration chooses to log those days, could run out at the end of May.

    "description": "Amazon has started testing another AI-powered feature called &quot; Buy for Me ,&quot; which allows the e-commerce company to make purchases for you from other websites. Specifically, from the actual website of a brand you&#39;re looking looking up. The experience is built into the Amazon app. When you search for an item from a particular brand, you may see a section of results labeled &quot;Shop brand sites directly&quot; separate from the results you&#39;ll get from Amazon and its third-party sellers.&nbsp; If you click on the &quot;Buy for Me&quot; button underneath an item in the separate results section, you&#39;ll be taken to a product detail page right inside the Amazon app. The company says the page will provide relevant product information similar to the product details in Amazon&#39;s own listings. Amazon will purchase the item for you from the brand&#39;s website if you decide to go through with the transaction. It uses agentic AI, a type of AI that doesn&#39;t need human intervention, to provide your name, address and payment details for the checkout process. Your details are encrypted, Amazon says, and it will not be able to see your previous and future orders from brands&#39; websites. You&#39;ll receive a confirmation email from the brand store itself for your purchase, but you can track your order within the Amazon app through the new Buy for Me Orders tab in the Your Orders page.&nbsp; The company told us that it&#39;s not getting a commission from your purchases made through the experimental feature, but it didn&#39;t say if it was going to get a cut from sales in the future. For now, the feature is still in beta and will only be available to a subset of customers on the US on its iOS and Amazon apps. The test will also only feature a limited number of brand stores and products for now. Just a few days ago, Amazon also released an AI-powered feature called &quot; Interests ,&quot; which can process prompts in every day language related to your, well, interests. You can, for instance, type in &quot;Brewing tools and gadgets for coffee lovers&quot; to get relevant notifications for Amazon&#39;s deals and offerings.&nbsp; Amazon Update, April 05, 2025, 09:25 AM ET: Amazon told us it&#39;s not getting a commission from this experimental feature. This story has been updated to reflect that.

    "description": "Jamie Siminoff, who founded Ring and started the company in his garage, is back at Amazon after leaving the company as its CEO in 2023. Siminoff joined Amazon when the e-commerce website acquired Ring in 2018, but he left in 2023 and founded another startup that he sold to lock maker Latch Inc. When he left Amazon two years ago, he said that invention was his true passion. Now, he&#39;s taking on the role as the vice president in charge of not just Ring, but also Amazon&#39;s smart home camera unit Blink, the company&#39;s in-garage delivery operations called Key and the Amazon Sidewalk low-bandwith, long-range shared network.&nbsp; Siminoff is replacing Elizabeth Hamren, who took over his role two years ago. Hamren used to be the COO of Discord and was also an executive at Microsoft and at Meta. According to Bloomberg , she&#39;s still looking for new opportunities from inside and outside the company.&nbsp; In a post welcoming him back posted on the Amazon website, Siminoff briefly and broadly talked about his plans for the divisions he&#39;s heading. He plans to focus on security, on making people feel their &quot;homes are safe, even when they’re thousands of miles away.&quot; Siminoff also wants to make sure Amazon&#39;s experiences related to home security &quot;work seamlessly across different types of devices.&quot; In addition, he talked about how he&#39;s going to explore the use of artificial intelligence in Amazon&#39;s products and services in the future. &quot;The AI transformation happening right now is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I think we’re super well positioned with helpful and practical AI features like Smart Video Search,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s just the start here — we&#39;re just scratching the surface of what we can do with AI — and I look forward to digging into this with the team even more.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ring-founder-jamie-siminoff-is-back-at-amazon-to-run-its-video-doorbell-unit-130009731.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-customize-your-iphones-home-screen-in-ios-18-120100872.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The official launch of Apple’s iOS 18 brought with it some fresh ways to customize your iPhone’s home screen. Rather than leaving unwanted apps hanging around like a bad smell in places you don’t want them, users can now take full control of app placement and make their home screen their own. Whether you're looking to add useful widgets, reorganize your apps or get rid of the ones you never use, customizing your iPhone home screen can help your device feel a little more unique. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to everything you can do to make your iOS 18 home screen look better and work the way you want. How to add, edit and remove widgets Widgets provide a convenient at-a-glance view of an app’s data or functionality, giving you quick access to information and reducing the need to open the app itself. A well-placed widget allows you to check the weather, view your calendar or access music controls, all without opening an app, giving your thumb a well-earned rest. Everybody loves a good shortcut, and with iOS 18, you can add, edit, or remove widgets easily, letting you jump straight to the information that matters. To add a widget: Touch and hold an empty area on your home screen until the app icons start to jiggle. Tap the Edit button in the top-left corner and select Add Widget . Scroll or search for the widget you want, then tap it. Swipe left or right to choose a size (some offer different layouts). Tap Add Widget to place it on your screen. Drag it to your preferred spot, then tap Done (top right). To edit a widget: Press and hold the widget you want to change. Tap Edit Widget (if available). If Edit Widget isn’t available, you can cycle through the icons for different placement and layout options. Adjust settings like what calendar it shows, which location for the weather, etc. These options will be unique to each app’s widget. To remove a widget: Press and hold the widget. Tap Remove Widget , then confirm. Rob Webb for Engadget How to move apps and widgets on the home screen Shuffling your home screen apps and widgets is also a cinch thanks to iOS 18’s customization overhaul. It’s a simple but useful way to personalize your iPhone’s home screen and declutter your wallpaper, so your loved ones' faces don’t become buried underneath a wall of app icons. Tap and hold on any app to reveal a menu. Select Edit Home Screen, where you can move the apps across pages by dragging them to the edge of the screen. Tap Done when you're finished. You can also stack one app on top of another to automatically create a folder (more on that below). How to customize apps and widgets on the home screen Moving your most-used apps into prime position is all well and good, but if you’re going for a particular aesthetic with your home screen, the default appearance of an app icon can sometimes spoil the overall look. Luckily, in iOS 18, you can exert more control over how your apps look, including the option to change app icon colors and how widgets are displayed. To customize your app icon colors: Press and hold on the home screen and tap Edit at the top. Choose Customize to change background colors (like dark, light or a custom color) or apply a different layout. However, bear in mind that not all app icons can change color. If these steps don’t work for you, you may be left with the odd rogue app icon, sticking out like a sore thumb. In which case, you can hide the app icon from view, while still being able to access it easily from the app library. How to lock or hide an app Security is a top priority, particularly when it comes to your smartphone. You might have certain apps you want to keep private and for your eyes only. If so, you’ll be happy to know that there are two ways in which you can prevent unwanted eyes on your apps. You can hide or lock an app behind a passcode or Face ID; this prevents unauthorized access and keeps your apps in a Hidden folder. Similarly, you can remove apps entirely from the home screen, still allowing you (and others if they have access) to view them in your App Library. To lock an app: Long-press the icon of the app you want to lock on the home screen. Select Require Face ID (or Touch ID or Passcode). Confirm your selection by pressing Require Face ID (or Touch ID or Passcode). To hide an app: Long-press the icon of the app you want to lock on the home screen. Select Require Face ID (or Touch ID or Passcode). Confirm your selection by pressing Require Face ID (or Touch ID or Passcode) Tap Hide and Require Face ID (or Touch ID or Passcode), then tap Hide App . How to organize your apps in folders Folders are a great way to declutter your home screen and keep similar apps grouped together. If you’re the type of person who likes to keep things tidy and organized, storing your apps in folders is a good way to do it. To create a folder: Drag one app icon over another, and iOS 18 will automatically create a folder with both. Tap the name to rename the folder (e.g., “Social” or “Work”). Drag in additional apps if you want. To remove a folder: Move all the apps out of the folder, and it will disappear once it’s empty. How to remove or delete apps The struggle is real when it comes to app bloat, and sometimes a bit of a spring clean is needed. If your home screen needs a bit of freshening up, you can kick a seldom-used app to the curb, or at least kick it off your home screen. To remove an app from the home screen (without deleting it): Tap and hold the app icon. Tap Remove App . Select Remove from Home Screen . When you want to use that app, navigate to the App Library (swipe left past your last home page) or swipe down from the top of your home screen to search for it. To delete an app completely: Tap and hold the app icon. Tap Remove App . Select Delete App , then confirm. To re-download a deleted app: Open the App Store , search for the app and tap the download icon. Rob Webb for Engadget A few more tips to personalize your home screen space Widgets Smart Stacks: Using this feature, you can combine multiple widgets into a stack you can swipe through. To do this, just drag one widget on top of another of the same size. App Library shortcuts: If you want a cleaner home screen, you can remove most apps and rely on the App Library (swipe all the way left) or the search tool to launch what you need. Focus mode customization: Each Focus mode can have its own custom home screen. This is a useful tool for separating your work life from your personal life.

    "description": "Mewgenics , the cat-breeding RPG that was originally announced as a follow-up to Super Meat Boy, is coming out in 2025, based on a new trailer shared by IGN and the game's updated Steam page . A blend of a turned-based RPG and twisted cat simulator, Mewgenics started as the next project from Team Meat, the development duo made up of Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes. Team Meat teased Mewgenics throughout 2013 , but ultimately put the game on hold in 2014 to focus on finishing Super Meat Boy Forever , a mobile sequel to Super Meat Boy . When McMillen ultimately left Team Meat in 2018 to focus on supporting The Binding of Isaac , Mewgenics came with him, &nbsp; and the game has been slowly making its way to release since then. If the trailer is any indication, repeatable, turn-based battles have become a big part of Mewgenics , but McMillen's trademark gross-out animation style remains intact (as does all of the cat furniture). If you're looking for more information about how the game has changed since it was announced over a decade ago, McMillen and co-developer Tyler Glaiel have kept up a relatively regular cadence of blog posts on Steam covering different aspects of the development process. We should also see a lot more of the game soon: In their latest update , Mewgenics ' developers shared that IGN is publishing hands-on coverage of the game in May.

    "description": "Early this year, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would be ditching its long-running fact checking program, claiming that it has enabled too much “censorship” on the company’s apps. Now, Meta has set an end date for fact-checking on Facebook, Instagram and Threads (at least for its US users).&nbsp; “By Monday afternoon, our fact-checking program in the US will be officially over,” Meta’s recently elevated policy chief Joel Kaplan announced in a post on X. “That means no new fact checks and no fact checkers.” Instead, Meta has been slowly ramping up Community Notes. Meta began allowing potential contributors to sign up in February . It began testing the system, which will initially be powered by the same algorithm as Community Notes on X, earlier this month. But the crowdsourced fact checks have yet to appear publicly on posts. It sounds like that’s also about to change with the official end of Meta’s existing fact checking partners. “The first Community Notes will start appearing gradually across Facebook, Threads &amp; Instagram, with no penalties attached,” Kaplan said. Though Meta has said it wants to eventually end fact checking entirely, the company has said relatively little about its plans for Community Notes outside of the US. That may be because officials in other countries, like Brazil and the European Union , have already expressed concern about how the change could affect the flow of disinformation around the world. Meta’s push to end fact checking in the US came early this year alongside several other policy changes that marked a notable rightward shift for the social network just as President Donals Trump took office. The company also ended corporate DEI programs , rolled back hate speech protections on its services and added a close Trump ally to its board .

    "description": "Microsoft just announced several updates to its Copilot AI assistant , and some sound downright useful. It’s bringing Copilot Vision to mobile, but with some new features. For the uninitiated, this software originally launched for the Edge web browser and gave Copilot the ability to “see” and comment on the contents of websites . The company is upping its game for the mobile version, adding some multimodal functionality. It’ll be able to integrate with your phone’s camera to “enable an interactive experience with the real world.” Microsoft says it can analyze both real-time video from the camera and photos stored on the device Microsoft gives an example of Copilot Vision analyzing a video of plants to determine if they are healthy or not and suggesting actions to take. We’ll see if it can actually perform that kind of nuanced reasoning. Modern AI companies love to promise the world and then, well, you know the rest . In any event, the mobile version of Vision is available today in the Copilot app for iOS and Android. The web version is also coming to Windows .&nbsp; Microsoft is bringing Copilot Search to Bing to “seamlessly blend the best of traditional and generative search together to help you find what you need.” The company is now calling Bing “your AI-powered search and answer engine.” Like most AI web search tools, this provides summaries to answer queries. Microsoft says this can take the form of a simple paragraph, like Gemini AI for Google searches, but that it also can provide “images and data from your favorite publishers and content owners.” Copilot Search is rolling out today . The company also introduced something called Copilot Memory. This is Microsoft’s attempt to bring more personalization to Copilot. After all, it’s tough to have a true AI companion when it doesn’t remember anything about you. With this addition, Copilot will be able to remember specific details about your life, like “your favorite food, the types of films you enjoy and your nephew’s birthday and his interests.” The company touts that the software will recommend actions based on what it remembers. To that end, Microsoft says Copilot will be able to do stuff like buy tickets to events, order flowers and make dinner reservations. It says the service will “work with most websites across the web.” We’ll see how that works out. The update brings some other tools to the table, like the ability to auto-generate podcasts based on specific topics and offer shopping advice based on sales history across the web. These updates begin rolling out today, but it may not hit every user for a bit. Microsoft says availability will expand in the coming weeks and months.

    "description": "TikTok is going to get more time to figure out a plan to stay in the US. President Donald Trump is signing another executive order effectively extending the deadline for the company to find US buyers by another 75 days. The president signaled he intended to give the deal more time via a Truth Social post . \"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,\" Trump wrote. \"The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.\"&nbsp; Trump's post suggests that the recently introduced suite of tariffs against US trade partners like China will somehow help close the deal. As part of the TikTok ban signed in to law by former President Biden in April 2024, TikTok's parent company ByteDance is forced to sell TikTok to a US buyer or get kicked out of US app stores and web hosting platforms.&nbsp; After a good bit of back and forth over the legality of the ban, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld it , and left the enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration. TikTok was briefly unavailable , but Trump ultimately signed an executive order that delayed the enforcement of the ban by 75 days to give TikTok more time to find a buyer and get the app back up and running. Multiple companies and groups have expressed interest in outright buying or investing in TikTok — reportedly, even Amazon — but no one has come to a deal that satisfies ByteDance or the Chinese government. It's not clear tariffs will change anyone's motivations, but if everyone continues to accept Trump's Justice Department just not enforcing the ban, than the whole ordeal seems like it could last as long as necessary.

    "description": "Vimeo is launching a new service that lets content creators run their own subscription service without needing coding experience. Vimeo Streaming removes the technical hurdles of building a monetized video service while avoiding the whack-a-mole game of chasing YouTube's algorithms or the often-meager payouts on TikTok and Instagram. The company says the product is ideal for media and entertainment creators, performing arts organizations, educators and e-learning companies, sports and event broadcasters and fitness studios. And since Vimeo is pitching less to individuals trying to build an audience from scratch, you'll need to contact the company's sales team for pricing details. The service provides tools and templates for \"a professional 'Netflix-style' streaming experience without any coding needed.\" Creators can tailor Vimeo Streaming's look and feel with custom branding, colors and logos. The service offers white-label web, mobile and TV apps for all major platforms, so you don't have to convince your audience to download the Vimeo app. Creators can organize and categorize videos, create playlists, include artwork and use custom layouts. Vimeo Monetization options include subscriptions (with free trials and payment processing), selling or renting videos on-demand, optional sponsorship ads and video bumpers and audience loyalty perks. It also supports live-streaming (including concurrent, backup and 24/7 streams), piracy protections and AI-powered subtitle translations in 36 languages. \"Vimeo is proud to serve the professional creator,\" CEO Philip Moyer told The Hollywood Reporter . \"We believe creators should be in control of their work and how they are paid, so we're taking the technologies that are usually only afforded by the biggest platforms and putting it in the hands of our customers at a fraction of the cost.\" You can learn more on Vimeo's product page .

    "description": "It was Tuesday June 25, 2019. San Francisco became the first US city to (temporarily) ban the sale of vapes, SpaceX successfully launched and deployed 24 satellites and I sat in Nintendo’s UK office on the outskirts of London, playing a demo of a game that still isn’t out .&nbsp; However, according to yesterday&#39;s Switch 2 presentation, Hollow Knight: Silksong will arrive at some point this year. Nintendo even showed off a couple of seconds of new footage. There are slopes ! Oh Silksong , oh Hollow Knight: Silksong , oh Hollow Knight ’s repurposed DLC. The second Hollow Knight game from Team Cherry was initially meant to be a DLC addition to the original, but plans changed , with the developers saying that it had become “too large and too unique.&quot; (This many years later, exactly how large and unique will Silksong be?) Later, as part of the 2022 Xbox and Bethesda Games showcase, a Silksong trailer teased a release date in the next 12 months as part of Xbox’s attempt to deliver a wave of exciting games after a lackluster start to the Series X/S launch. When the early 2023 release date passed us by, Team Cherry delayed the game into 2024 and now, well, it’s 2025. I played that demo so long ago that it might have just been a dream. Without rewriting my six-year-old hands-on impressions entirely, the new game features a new playable character named Hornet, who featured as a repeatable boss fight in the original Hollow Knight , with silk-based attacks and faster, more agile gameplay. It also offers a more aggressive play style, with Hornet able to heal herself using silk charges and even repair damage with silk bundles left behind from prior unsuccessful attempts. It&#39;s a different gameplay twist from having to beat the Hollow Knight shadow in the original. I subtitled my hands-on impressions, saying it would be “worth the wait.” Back then, I&#39;d recently finished Hollow Knight on the Switch, putting in a few too many hours and was hungry for more bug-shaped Metroidvania adventures. Silksong felt fresh, more responsive, faster and flashier — and I just wanted to play more Hollow Knight. Barely six seconds of footage during Nintendo&#39;s Switch 2 presentation was enough to re-ignite the Silksong fandom, when it revealed nothing new more than some downhill traversal. It&#39;s proof that a lot of people are still excited — and still waiting. I&#39;m excited, and six years on, it feels like it must be pretty close.&nbsp; Right?

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",
    "description": "You’re probably thinking of subscribing to a live TV streaming service so you can watch some combination of sports, news and/or local channels. For a long time, cable and broadcast signals were the only way to access that programming, but these days TVs don’t even have built-in digital antennas — and despite decades of consumer irritation, cable still requires impossible-to-cancel contracts. When live TV streaming arrived about a decade ago, it was hailed as a low-cost, contract-free alternative for cord-cutters. Unfortunately, every major streaming service — YouTube TV , Hulu + Live TV , Sling , Philo , DirecTV Steam , and Fubo — has raised prices significantly over the past few years. Philo and Sling are the only holdouts you can get for less than $50 monthly. Almost in compensation, however, at the other end of the cost spectrum lies a slew of free live streaming services such as Tubi, Pluto and Plex. The line between live TV and traditional streaming is getting harder to discern, too, with services like Peacock, Prime Video, Max and other VOD services showing live sporting events and live shows. Taken all together, there’s a lot to consider when you’re trying to pick the best live TV streaming service — so we tested every major option, spelling out the pros, cons and features each gives you to help you out. Editor’s Note : We’re heading into the final days of the 2025 NCAA Tournaments, aka March Madness . And if you’re looking for a way to watch both the women’s and men’s Final Four and National Championship games, a live TV streaming service such as YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Fubo and Sling will work, as they all carry the necessary channels (ESPN and ABC for the women’s final games and CBS for the men’s). However, there are cheaper options. An ESPN+ subscription is $12 per month and it will air all of the final four women’s games as well as the NCAA Women's Championship. If you just want to watch the final men’s games, a $13-per-month Paramount+ with Showtime subscription will cover those events .. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games . Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels . The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus , which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. But for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree , though we haven’t had a chance to test that one yet. Here's the best of what we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app . Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna , you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations , and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max ( formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on . You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games . Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi . While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper too. While the promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year, shortly after, DirecTV announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&amp;E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on , after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV ( FAST ) including Freevee , Tubi , PlutoTV and Sling Freestream . These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel , the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV . Back to top How we tested When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town . I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen . Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million . How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials. Back to top Recent updates January 31, 2025 : Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle. January 16, 2025 : Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package. December 31, 2024 : Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service. August 6, 2024 : Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu.&nbsp; June 12, 2024 : Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.

    "description": "Mario Kart 8 &nbsp; and its Deluxe update have been around so long it&#39;s easy to forget that the game actually predates the Switch and can trace its origins way back to the Wii U. But every good run must come to an end, and with the forthcoming arrival of the Switch 2 on June 5, Mario Kart World is looking like the ideal launch partner. Now there hasn&#39;t really ever been a bad Mario Kart game, but World feels like Nintendo has jammed nitrous into every corner and crevice. Even during my demo session where not all the characters were unlocked, I got the sense that its roster is massive. All the big names are there like Peach and Yoshi, but you also have baby versions of many of them alongside Toadette, Pauline, Nabbit and so much more. This feeling extends to a range of vehicles too, which includes standard karts in addition to stuff like jet skis and scooters. Editor&#39;s note: This hands-on focuses on our writer&#39;s experience with the game Mario Kart World before its release alongside the Switch 2 in June. If you want his impressions of the gaming console itself, check out his Switch 2 hands-on , which covers the hardware, playing experience and changes from the original model. Since this article was published, Nintendo has announced that US pre-orders for the Switch 2 will be delayed indefinitely so it can &quot;assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.&quot; Those in America can no longer order one on April 9 as previously shared. Sam Rutherford for Engadget But more importantly, the world feels huge. Not only can you freely roam around tracks as they seamlessly connect from one to another, there are also little details like weather effects and day/night shifts that make things feel more alive. And there&#39;s also a seemingly huge range of tracks to choose from, organized into several Grand Prix circuits. The most fun I had, though, was when I got a chance to play the Knockout Tour mode, which is like Mario Kart meets F-Zero 99 . In this setting, you have 24 people in a single race that progresses across multiple tracks. Every few laps, the last four places get eliminated, so it&#39;s your job to dodge shells and use every last mushroom boost, shortcut and power slide to stay at the front of the pack. It&#39;s a non-stop frenzy that just keeps going and, though I don&#39;t have the same reaction speed I did when I was younger, this old-head still got first place. And even after a win, I just wanted more. (For the record, Nintendo&#39;s photography policy required me to have a person in the frame, so a friendly staff member stood in my place, but here&#39;s my receipt.) Sam Rutherford for Engadget I also need to call out that Mario Kart World has a 120 fps mode and it&#39;s damn good. Racing has never looked this smooth on any Nintendo console and this game might be the best first-party showcase of the Switch 2&#39;s upgraded display and performance. That said, the best part is that I&#39;m sure I missed some features because I didn&#39;t even have a chance to try out the outfit customization Nintendo teased in World &#39;s trailer. And I was so focused on winning that I didn&#39;t fully explore the expanded list of tricks like grinding on rails and hopping off vertical walls. Granted, it&#39;s a bummer that Nintendo has raised the price of many Switch 2 games, particularly with Mario Kart World coming in at $80 for a digital copy or $90 for a physical cart. But that can be largely avoided by purchasing the Switch 2 bundle that comes with the game, which effectively brings its price back down to $50. So if you are planning on getting a Switch 2 at launch, opting for this combo feels like a no-brainer. Update, April 4 2025, 11:52AM ET: This story has been updated to include an Editor&#39;s Note pointing out where readers can find our hands-on impressions of the Switch 2 itself, as well as the latest news that pre-orders for the device have been delayed following the announcement of widespread tariffs.

The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.\" Previously, as part of its most recent Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo announced the April 9 pre-order date for North America, along with the June 5 date for wider availability. The starting price was to be $450, but it's unclear if that will change now in response to these proposed tariffs. Participating retailers will also be selling the Switch 2 when it eventually makes its way to the U.S. We expect those to include Amazon , Best Buy , GameStop , Walmart and others. There's some fine-print attached to pre-ordering directly from Nintendo. According to the pre-order page on Nintendo's site, you must be 18 years or older, sign in with your Nintendo account and register your interest in pre-ordering. Then, you'll be sent an invitation email when it's time to play your pre-order, and the invitation will be valid for 72 hours. And then there's this bit of info: \"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025.\" That seems to mean those who have paid for Switch Online in the recent past and those who have spent a good amount of time playing Switch games as of late will get first pick at buying a Switch 2. There's no telling if these same restrictions will apply if you want to pre-order from third-party retailers. We knew from the teaser trailer for the Switch 2 that Nintendo's new hardware would be bigger and would have a new approach to the detachable Joy-Cons. The new Joy-Con 2 have a new C button, mouse controls and a built in gyroscope for tilt control. The console has a built-in mic to support a new feature called Game Chat that will let you communicate with friends in-game. The device is indeed a bit larger, with a 7.9-inch LCD screen that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR and a 1080p resolution. When docked, you'll be able to play at up to 4K on your TV, and Nintendo says it improved the consoles internal speakers as well. The new dock also has a built-in fan to keep the console cool and help maintain performance during long play sessions. The Switch 2 has dual USB-C ports for charging, and the base storage amount has increased to 256GB. The Switch 2's storage can be expanded like the previous model, but it will only work with newer microSD Express cards. The Switch 2 has a number of accessories that you'll be able to purchase separately as well, including the new Switch 2 camera for $50, a new Switch 2 Pro controller for $80, an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers for $90, a Joy-Con 2 charging grip for $35 and more.

    "description": "A four-pack of Samsung’s SmartTag 2 trackers is on sale for $58 via Woot . That’s a massive discount of 42 percent, as the regular price is $100. This combo pack ships with two black trackers and two white trackers. They easily made our list of the best Bluetooth trackers . We appreciated the vast finding network, as there are a lot of Samsung phones out there contributing to it. We said the network is “larger than anything out there for Android.” The trackers offer a decent battery life of 16 months, and the batteries are replaceable. There’s also a large hole for keychains, which is something Apple AirTags lack. The ring volume is also louder than both AirTags and Tile Pro trackers. These trackers are fairly hearty, with IP67 water and dust-resistance. Setup is simple, as the companion app walks users through just about everything. There’s only one downside, but it’s a doozy. SmartTag trackers only work with Samsung tablets and phones. This doesn’t really impact the finding network, as there are millions of Samsung devices out there, but does limit who should make this purchase.

    "description": "With Nintendo&#39;s April 2 Direct showcase over and done, we now know more about the Switch 2 than ever before, including its release date (June 5) and price ($450!). Thanks to Nintendo&#39;s January 16 teaser trailer , we&#39;ve long known what the Switch 2 will look like, and that it will arrive in 2025 — over eight years after its predecessor. The Nintendo Switch 2 looks very similar to the original system, albeit with a larger display, magnetic Joy-Cons and a sleeker design. The company also reaffirmed that the upcoming console will be backwards compatible with Switch games. Looking to catch up on everything we know about the Switch 2? Read on. What are the key new features of the Nintendo Switch 2? Display and dock The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 1080p 7.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh and HDR compatibility. It also supports up to 4K output at 120Hz (with variable refresh rates) when docked. Joy-Con and Pro Controller The new Joy-Con for Nintendo Switch 2 attaches magnetically with a button to release them. They have larger SL and SR buttons (the ones hidden when the Joy-Con are attached) to make playing multiplayer games on one Joy-Con more feasible. The analog sticks are no longer tiny nubs, and are closer in size to the ones you might find on a PS5 or Xbox controller. They have what Nintendo is calling “HD Rumble 2” built in, which seems to be a refinement of the original (and still very good) vibration function. Finally, each Joy-Con has an optical sensor that allows you to use it as a mouse , and a C button, which we’ll get to in a minute. Nintendo The new Pro Controller for the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with everything you’d expect based on the refreshed Joy-Con: Namely HD Rumble 2 and the C button. There are also remappable GL/GR buttons around the back and a standard audio jack for connecting a headset. Both options come with Amiibo support built in. The Switch 2 comes with two Joy-Con as you’d expect, and additional pairs are priced at $90. The Pro Controller will cost $80. The C button stands for “chat” The new C button is a dedicated way to enter a chat session with friends. As well as the standard features you’d expect from voice chat, Nintendo has built a Discord-like video-sharing feature, which lets you show your gameplay to others and see other people’s screens while you’re playing.&nbsp; The chat function works with a mic built into the console, though headsets are also supported. Nintendo will also sell a $50 camera that plugs into the USB-C port on the top of the console, which will allow you to stream your face along with your game. Nintendo GameCube support The Switch 2 will work with GameCube games via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The three titles available at launch will be F-Zero GX , The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur II . Improved specs Perhaps the biggest feature, though, is one you can’t see: The Switch 2 has an all-new processor and GPU and significantly more storage (256GB vs 64GB in the Switch OLED), along with support for faster and more capacious microSD cards. This will obviously lead to better first-party games and upgraded Switch experiences, but more importantly it will mean multi-platform games that had to skip the original, underpowered Switch will be able to be ported over. With games like Cyberpunk 2077 coming to the Switch 2 at launch , it seems like far more ports will be feasible than on the original console. Another major improvement comes in the form of networking — the Switch 2 supports WiFi 6, which will improve the original&#39;s often glacial download speeds. Similarly, the new dock sports an ethernet port for a rock-solid connection. What&#39;s it like to play? Nintendo gave the press a chance to check out the Switch 2 and a few of the games it highlighted. You can read our impressions of Mario Kart World &nbsp; as well as more general thoughts on how the Switch 2 feels in person . Right off the bat, Mario Kart World feels like an outstanding launch title, with more depth and better visuals than we&#39;ve ever seen from a Mario Kart game. The core formula is intact, but there are a lot of new features and play styles to dig into.&nbsp; As for the Switch 2 hardware, it feels like a major step forward from the original Switch — it has grown up a lot and feels far more polished and refined. And while it may not have an OLED screen, the 7.9-inch LED display Nintendo did use is outstanding. How much will the Nintendo Switch 2 cost? The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for $450 standalone, or for $500 with a bundled digital copy of the new Mario Kart game, Mario Kart World. That’s significantly more expensive than the original Switch, which launched at $300, and has remained at that price ever since. It’s also more expensive than the entry-level current-gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft. The comparison looks a little better up against Valve’s Steam Deck , which costs $400 for the LCD model or $550 for the basic OLED model. The Steam Deck is more affordable than most PC handhelds. When will the Nintendo Switch 2 come out? June 5, 2025. When do pre-orders open for Nintendo Switch 2? Pre-orders were originally set to begin on April 9, but on April 4 Nintendo announced it was suspending pre-order plans &quot;indefinitely.&quot; However, it says that the release date is unchanged. How long will the Switch 2&#39;s battery last? Nintendo says that the Switch 2 will last between 2 and 6.5 hours. This is similar to the original Switch, which was rated for 2.5-6.5 hours, though later revisions upped that figure significantly. The company cautions that &quot;this time is an estimate ... battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions.&quot; When can I try the Nintendo Switch 2? Nintendo is planning a worldwide roadshow to let gamers go hands-on with the console. These events start in New York and Paris on April 4-6, with others taking place throughout the following two months.&nbsp; Ticket registration for many of the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events has closed, but waitlists are available . However, given that Nintendo is taking a first come, first served approach, your chances of attending the roadshow if you don&#39;t already have a ticket (or unless you signed up for the waitlist immediately) seem very small at this point. The full list of Nintendo Switch 2 Experience dates is as follows: North America: New York, April 4-6, 2025 Los Angeles, April 11-13, 2025 Dallas, April 25-27, 2025 Toronto, April 25-27, 2025 Europe: Paris, April 4-6, 2025 London, April 11-13, 2025 Milan, April 25-27, 2025 Berlin, April 25-27, 2025 Madrid, May 9-11, 2025 Amsterdam, May 9-11, 2025 Oceania: Melbourne, May 10-11, 2025 Asia: Tokyo (Makuhari), April 26-27, 2025 Seoul, May 31-June 1, 2025 Hong Kong, To be announced Taipei, To be announced Is the Nintendo Switch 2 backwards compatible? Nintendo confirmed in November 2024 that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible. It will also feature access to Nintendo Online, so users will be able to play all of those old retro titles. In the initial Nintendo Switch 2 press release, Nintendo reiterated that physical and digital Switch games will work on the new system. However, it noted that &quot;certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.&quot; We now have more information on which games are working thanks to a guide Nintendo put together . Nintendo&#39;s software compatibility chart on April 2, 2025. Nintendo As of April 1, the vast majority of Switch 2 games are marked as compatible, but many popular games are said to have some issues. Nintendo has marked most of these as “under investigation,” suggesting a fix may be on the way in time for launch. Nintendo says it is manually testing every Switch game for compatibility. Only one title is marked as incompatible: Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit . This was part of Nintendo’s Labo range of games that worked with Cardboard accessories, and is incompatible as the Switch 2 doesn’t physically fit in the VR headset. Will old games be enhanced in any way? The original Switch has, to put it mildly, struggled to run some of the late-generation software that&#39;s come down the pike. Could these games be enhanced to take advantage of the increased horsepower of the Switch 2? That’s unclear. In an “ Ask the Developer ” page on its site, Nintendo says that old games are working through a real-time translation system, which sounds similar to how Rosetta allows modern Macs to run old software. With that said, the new and old Switch are much closer in hardware than that. In the same developer interview, it’s said that in its testing of old games for compatibility, there were some occasions “where loading times became faster, or game performance became more stable,” but we don’t have any detail beyond that. As well as backward compatibility, Nintendo is also offering up premium ‘Switch 2 Edition” upgrades for a select few games, which have improved resolutions and frame rates, and (in some titles) some bonus features and content. What exactly that means will vary, but Nintendo did confirm that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will have 4K/60 and 1080p/120 options on the Switch 2. In the case of the two mainline Zelda games, those will be free to Switch Online Expansion Pack members, while others will be paid upgrades. Games confirmed to have a Switch 2 Edition to date include: Super Mario Party Jamboree The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Kirby and the Forgotten Land Pokémon Legends: Z-A Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Nintendo has not said how much the paid upgrades will cost. What will the cartridges taste like? You may remember that the original Switch cartridges taste absolutely awful . This was on purpose, to discourage folks from putting the games in their mouth. Will the successor follow suit and continue to dip cartridges in a foul-tasting bitter coating? Only time will tell. What are the launch games? We expect this list to change substantially over the coming weeks and months, but the titles currently confirmed to be available on day one follow: Arcade Archives 2 Ridge Racer Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Cyberpunk 2077 Deltarune Fast Fusion Fortnite Hitman: World of Assassination Hogwarts Legacy Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Mario Kart World Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Split Fiction Street Fighter 6 Survival Kids Yakuza 0: Director&#39;s Cut That&#39;s everything we know about the Nintendo Switch 2 today.

    "description": "Nintendo has delayed US Switch 2 pre-orders in response to the new set of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier this week, as first reported by Polygon . Following Nintendo&#39;s announcement of the console on Wednesday, pre-orders in the United States were slated to open on April 9. They&#39;re now delayed indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the US will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,&quot; the company told Engadget. &quot;Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.&quot; As mentioned earlier, Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2 on April 2. Hours later, the Trump administration said it would impose a sweeping set of new tariffs targeted against a broad swath of countries, including Japan, China and Vietnam. Products from the latter two countries, where Nintendo manufactures much of its hardware, will be subject to import duties of 54 percent and 46 percent, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, Nintendo said the Switch 2 would cost $450. As Polygon notes, sticker shock was already dominating the conversation around Nintendo&#39;s new handheld, with many fans begging the company to &quot;drop the price!&quot; of console during its recent livestreams. It&#39;s unclear what could happen following Nintendo&#39;s assessment of the situation, but one possibility is that the company could allocate less stock for the US market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-delays-switch-2-us-pre-orders-following-trump-tariffs-150747208.html?src=rss",

    "description": "You can snag Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a record-low price right now. Amazon has one of our top picks for the best wireless earbuds for only $179, which is 22 percent off their regular price. The discount applies to multiple colorways, too, including black, pink, beige and green. These made our top picks list thanks to their comfortable, secure design and the addition of Google's Tensor chip to handle audio and noise-cancellation processing. They also offer a hands-free way to initiate Gemini AI. However, the main reason we recommend these earbuds is that they sound great. They provide a good low-end, which is tough to do with earbuds, and crunchy highs. Google says it redesigned the entire audio system and it shows. We called out the “noticeable improvement” over the original Pixel Buds Pro earbuds in our official review . There are plenty of nifty features to set these earbuds apart from the competition. They can detect conversations and automatically adjust audio accordingly. Find My Device support is also included. They offer spatial audio with certain apps. The buds get around eight hours of use per charge, but 30 hours when considering the included charging case.&nbsp; There are only two downsides here. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds are incredibly small, which is cool, that means making adjustments on their equally tiny touch panels can be difficult. Also, the original asking price of $229 is certainly high. This sale alleviates that particular issue. Elsewhere on Amazon, other Google gear has been discounted as well. The Pixel Buds A-Series are on sale for $79, which represents a 20 percent discount, and the Google Pixel Tablet is 30 percent off and down to $279. The A-Series earbuds are a parred-down version of the flagships, while the Pixel Tablet is your only option if you want a Google-made Android slab. Just note the tablet on sale does not come with its optional speaker dock. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/midjourney-launches-its-new-v7-ai-image-model-that-can-process-text-prompts-better-134546883.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Midjourney has released the alpha version of V7, which it says is an &quot;entirely new&quot; AI image generation model and is much smarter at processing your text prompts. The image quality of its output is noticeably higher, the Midjourney team says, and can create better textures, bodies and hands. AI image generators typically struggle with creating accurate depictions of hands, but based on photos posted by some users on their socials, V7 is capable of spitting out some photorealistic images of human hands.&nbsp; The new model comes with a feature called &quot;Draft Mode,&quot; which can render images at half the speed the program usually takes. Its results are rougher and less detailed, but it will cost half of what a standard generation costs. Midjourney says Draft Mode is the best way to iterate on ideas. You can use it, say, if you&#39;re collaborating with someone and just spitballing ideas with them — it works with voice, so you don&#39;t even have to type out each other&#39;s suggestions — or if you&#39;re unsure what kind of vibe you&#39;re going for. If you like an image Midjourney creates in Draft Mode, you can click &quot;enhance&quot; or &quot;vary&quot; on it to re-render it at full quality.&nbsp; At launch, V7 will have Turbo and Relax modes for standard rendering, with the former costing twice as much as a normal speed job on the V6 model. Midjourney needs more time to optimize its standard speed mode for V7, but it will make the option available in the future. The new mode is missing more capabilities, as well, including upscaling, editing and retexturing, which will fall back to the program&#39;s V6 model for now. Midjourney promises to roll out new updates for the model every week or two over the next two months. To be able to test the alpha version of V7, you&#39;ll have to unlock your personalization profile first. Midjourney describes personalization as &quot;a style assistant for your image creations,&quot; since it teaches the AI your visual preferences. You&#39;ll have to rank at least 200 pairs of images to create a V7 Global Personalization Profile and test the model. Personalization is switched on by default for the V7, but you&#39;ll be able to switch it off if you want.&nbsp; One of the most exciting new features for our new V7 model is something we call &quot;Draft Mode&quot;. Draft mode is half the cost and 10 times the speed and it might be the best way to iterate on ideas ever. Try it with voice, think out loud and let our ideas flow like liquid dreams. pic.twitter.com/ANfTMC6Ej1 — Midjourney (@midjourney) April 4, 2025 This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/midjourney-launches-its-new-v7-ai-image-model-that-can-process-text-prompts-better-134546883.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-stream-march-madness-2025-watch-the-final-four-games-on-april-4-and-5-181552477.html?src=rss",
    "description": "By now, your brackets were likely busted a long time ago. The 2025 NCAA Tournaments, affectionately known to many as March Madness , are coming to a close. Both the men's and women's Final Four — the semifinal games — are happening this weekend, with the championship to follow in subsequent days. Different broadcasters own the rights to each tournament, so streaming both installments of the Final Four can be confusing. I’ve broken down the best, most affordable way to access each one so that you'll be ready when the games begin on Friday. When is the Final Four? The women's NCAA basketball Final Four is Friday, April 4. 1-seed Texas takes on fellow 1-seed South Carolina at 7:00PM ET, then 2-seed UConn will battle 1-seed UCLA in the other semifinal match up at 9:30PM ET. The winners to play for the national championship on Sunday, April 6 at 3:00PM ET. All three of these games will be on ESPN and ESPN+. The men's NCAA basketball Final Four is Saturday, April 5. The 1-seed Auburn takes on familiar SEC foe and fellow 1-seed Florida at 6:09PM ET. Following that game at 8:49PM ET, 1-seed Houston will face 1-seed Duke. The winners will play for the national championship on Monday, April 7 at 8:50PM ET. All three of these games will be on CBS. How to watch the Final Four and championship games All of the women's games will be available on ESPN and ESPN+, which means you can watch via a live TV streaming service or in the ESPN app (with a TV log-in or ESPN+ subscription). The most affordable way to watch these games is with a $12/month ESPN+ plan. All men's games will air on CBS, where you have the option of streaming on a live TV service or via Paramount+. The most affordable way to watch these games is with a $13/month Paramount+ with Showtime plan.&nbsp; You could also try a streaming trial this weekend if one is available. Hulu + Live TV , for example, gives you three days to test its service, while DirecTV Stream gives five — both of them have both CBS and ESPN. The Hulu plan is available to both new and returning customers, so it might be an option to watch most of the action from both tournaments. Since all of the games are spread over four days, you won't get everything, but if you're only watching one or the other, this is a viable way to save some money.&nbsp; The rest of this story includes a more complete March Madness overview, including content that was originally published prior to the start of the tournaments. When does March Madness start? The men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament begins on Tuesday, March 18 with two of the so-called First Four matchups. These are the four games that are used to determine the final four teams in the main 64-team bracket. To some, they’re known as the “play-in games” although they’ve officially been part of the men's tournament since 2011. The first game on March 18 begins at 6:40PM ET with another to follow at 9:10PM ET. The same schedule is expected for the second slate of games on Wednesday, March 19. On the women’s side, March Madness is offset from the men’s tournament by a day. The first two of the First Four games are Wednesday, March 19 at 7PM ET and 9PM ET. The second pair of matchups follows on Thursday, March 20 in the same two time slots. The 64-team bracket kicks off in earnest for the men at 12:15PM ET on Thursday, March 20. For the women, the main action begins at 11:30AM ET on Friday, March 21st. Here’s the full schedule for each tournament: 2025 Men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament First Four: March 18-19 First round: March 20-21 Second round: March 22-23 Sweet 16: March 27-28 Elite Eight: March 29-30 Final Four: April 5 Championship game: April 7 2025 Women’s NCAA Basketball Tournament First Four: March 19-20 First round: March 21-22 Second round: March 23-24 Sweet 16: March 28-29 Elite Eight: March 30-31 Final Four: April 4 Championship game: April 6 How to stream the 2025 Men’s NCAA Tournament ASSOCIATED PRESS CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery share the broadcast rights to the men’s tournament, and as they have in years past, TV coverage will be spread across four networks. During the course of March Madness, games will air on CBS, TNT, TBS and truTV, with the final rounds and championship game landing on CBS. If you already have a paid TV plan (such as traditional cable), a good way to watch the men’s tournament is with the March Madness Live app or website. There's a big catch though: CBS games aren't available in the app. That means this is really only a good option through the Elite Eight. Once you log in with your TV provider credentials, you can watch games on the other networks in one spot with features like multiview (up to four games at once), “excitement alerts” that let you know when there’s a close game and a Fast Break stream that covers of all the in-progress games in one spot.&nbsp; The app also offers ways to follow your bracket, if you filled it out on MarchMadness.com. And when you’re watching on desktop, the crucial Boss Button will throw up a fake work screen when you need it. March Madness Live is also available on Amazon, Fire TV, Apple TV, iOS, macOS, Google Play, LG smart TVs, Roku and Xbox devices. Your most affordable option to watch every game is to actually use two services. It’s not ideal, I know, but it will save you a lot of money. Max’s Basic plan is $10/month and gives you access to live games from TNT, TBS and truTV with three-game multiview. B/R Sports, which powers all of the live coverage on Max, will only be available on the pricier Standard and Premium levels starting March 30. That's not a problem since games after that date will only air on CBS. For the CBS games, you’ll need a Paramount+ with Showtime subscription that costs $13/month. So, in total, your best option to stream all of the men’s tournament is $23 spread across two apps.&nbsp; A live TV service like YouTube TV or Hulu plus Live TV is over $50 more per month at full price, but they would offer you “one-stop shopping” for all the games in the men’s tournament. YouTube TV is currently on sale for $70/month for the first six months you use it.&nbsp; How to stream the 2025 Women’s NCAA Tournament ASSOCIATED PRESS While Warner Brothers Discovery owns the rights to the men’s NCAA Tournament, ESPN has the women’s bracket locked down. Every game of the women’s tournament will be spread across ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNEWS, including the First Four matchups. The Final Four will be on ESPN, but the championship game will air on ABC. All three of those culminating games will stream on ESPN+. Since ESPN+ won’t get every game, it’s not an option if you want to watch the entire tournament. You will be able to watch “select matchups” on both ESPN+ and Disney+, but ESPN hasn’t announced what those will be. So, unfortunately, your best bet is a live-TV streaming service like Sling, YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV for a comprehensive experience. Sling is the cheapest avenue here, with the requisite Orange and Sports Extra plans costing $34 (Sling is currently offering a discount on the first month of Orange). YouTube and Hulu live TV options are both the same price at $83/month (YouTube TV currently discounted to $70 for the first six months), so it’s a matter of which set of content and features you like best. YouTube TV offers a handy multiview tool so you can watch up to four games at once, but Hulu + Live TV comes with Disney+ and ESPN+ (both with ads) for that cost. (Opting for Hulu + Live TV only saves you one whole dollar per month if you don’t include the Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu bundling.) If you’re a more casual fan who can afford to roll the dice on the “select” options on ESPN+, you can save some money. That service only costs $12/month. And if you already have a TV plan that includes the ESPN family of networks, the ESPN app is the best place to watch the tournament. The mix of scores and info, along with multiview streaming for up to four games at a time on Apple TV and Xbox, make the app a well-equipped conduit for the women’s tournament. The March Madness website only shows scores and news for the women’s tournament. There are no live games available on the website. What if I want to stream both the men’s and women’s tournaments? ASSOCIATED PRESS If you’re hoping to stream all of both the men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments, I hope you ordered Samsung’s eight-TV bundle . In terms of streaming services, just jump straight to a live-TV option like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV. I prefer the former because of its multiview feature – a tool that Hulu doesn’t offer. At times when there are multiple games that you want to watch, especially during the first two rounds, you’ll want multiview in order to keep tabs on all of the action. Are any of the March Madness games available to stream for free? You can watch all of the games broadcast on CBS on the March Madness website and mobile apps without a TV provider. Sure, it’s a small sample of the tournament, but it’s completely free and a good option for casual fans who don’t have a paid TV plan they can exploit for more of the action. It’s also a good option for watching the first round at work, if your company hasn’t blocked streaming sites, or if you can discreetly watch on your phone. For the women’s tournament, there aren’t any games available for free. Unless you have an old-school OTA antenna, in which case you can watch men’s games on CBS and women’s games on ABC without any kind of streaming plan. Of course, this is a streaming guide so I’d consider an antenna an extraordinary move in 2025. If you were hoping to use a free trial period to watch March Madness, I’ve got bad news. None of them will be long enough to watch an entire tournament. Some of them don’t offer them at all, but the longest is YouTube TV at 10 days which wouldn’t get you through the second weekend. Update, March 20, 2025 12:19PM ET: This guide has been updated to clarify the games available on March Madness Live and to update game availability and pricing for Max.

    "description": "You have to go all the way back to the Nintendo 64 to play the most recent 3D Donkey Kong game. But without a new mainline Zelda or Mario title ( Mario Kart World &nbsp; doesn&#39;t quite count) queued up for the Switch 2&#39;s launch in June, Nintendo&#39;s favorite ape is getting some time to shine in Donkey Kong Bananza . And after getting a chance to play a demo of the game prior to its release on July 17, I have to say I&#39;m loving this glowed-up gorilla. Now, I&#39;m not entirely sure how DK went from the jungle to being stuck in the banana mines because the demo just kind of dropped me in without a ton of context. Regardless, there&#39;s no doubt that this is the best the gorilla has ever looked. He&#39;s got a fresh, almost cell-shaded look not entirely dissimilar to the art style seen in recent Zelda games , along with a more youthful and expressive appearance. And it seems his time spent digging has garnered him some new skills as well, which include the ability to punch, dig and butt stomp his way below, into and through all sorts of terrain, with dirt flying everywhere as you do it. Sam Rutherford for Engadget This opens up a world (cave?) of exploration because now DK can tunnel through to new locations or shape his surroundings with a ground pound, though there&#39;s also the usual assortment of actions like running and jumping. This type of freedom immediately changes the way you tackle obstacles compared to a standard platformer. Nearly everything is destructible in some way, and between digging, rolling or simply chucking giant rocks at foes, it feels like there are multiple ways to get where you need to go. Granted, you still have familiar tropes like collecting jeweled bananas and of course, a companion in the form of a friendly purple rock monster that rides on DK&#39;s shoulder. But make no mistake, this ain&#39;t the same country DK has swung through before. Thanks to all of its new traversal mechanics, in a lot of ways, Bananza reminds me more of Mario Galaxy than Odyssey. It&#39;s just swapped out the gravity-bending physics for bombastic spelunking. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, while the game looks great and handles well, I do have some initial concerns. After a while, the constant digging and rock smashing felt a bit button-mashy. Plus, all the ricks and detritus that gets kicked up becomes a distraction, as I would kind of like to actually see where I&#39;m going. There really is a ton of earth that needs moving. This makes me wonder if the game is aimed at a slightly younger audience similar to a lot of Kirby games rather than something meant to appeal to older players. But even though I only had a brief time with the game, I saw more than enough to make me want to come back. And alongside Mario Kart World , it&#39;s exceedingly clear that Donkey Kong Bananza is part of Nintendo&#39;s giant punch that will carry the Switch 2 through its launch window.

    "description": "The trailer for M3GAN 2.0 is here and if you were expecting a copy-paste of the original&#39;s horror vibe, you may be surprised. Instead, the sequel is embracing a turn towards action in vein of Terminator 2 complete with upgrades to the original doll, a robot showdown and... a wing suit?&nbsp; Set to arrive in theaters only on June 27, the film is once again directed by Gerard Johnstone and features returning cast members Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps, along with newcomer Ivanna Sakhno ( Pacific Rim: Uprising ) as Amelia.&nbsp; It&#39;s two years after the original M3GAN doll went on a murderous rampage (including that wild dance sequence) and was eventually destroyed. Since then, its designer Gemma has become an author and voice for more robust AI oversight, while Gemma&#39;s niece Cady (who M3GAN 1.0 swore to protect) is now a teenager. Meanwhile, M3GAN&#39;s AI tech was stolen by a defense contractor to build super robot solidier Amelia. However, the experiment went awry and Amelia seeks murderous revenge against the AI&#39;s creators, particularly Gemma and Cady. Despite misgivings (mostly over the fact that M3GAN tried to murder her), Gemma decides to resurrect the OG doll to combat Amelia, and even adds updates to make her faster, stronger and, well, taller.&nbsp; That sets up a showdown between M3GAN and Amelia, complete with guns, a Teletubby version of M3GAN, catchphrases (&quot;hold on to your vagina&quot;) and the aforementioned wingsuit sequence. It has strong shades of Terminator 2 with the original robot doll protecting a key character from a new upgraded model. That&#39;s married with a camp aesthetic, lots of blood and even a creepy usage of Britney Spears&#39; Oops I did it Again .&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/watch-m3gan-switch-from-horror-to-action-in-the-new-sequel-trailer-125749110.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Following the release of rival Anthropic&#39;s Claude for Education , OpenAI has announced that its $20 ChatGPT Plus tier will be free for college students until the end of May. The offer comes just in time for final exams and will provide features like OpenAI&#39;s most advanced LLM, GPT-4o and an all-new image generation tool .&nbsp; &quot;We are offering a Plus discount for students on a limited-time basis in the US and Canada,&quot; the company wrote in a FAQ . &quot;This is an experimental consumer program and we may or may not expand this to more schools and countries over time.&quot; On top of the aforementioned features, ChatGPT Plus will offer students benefits like priority access during peak usage times and higher message limits. It&#39;ll also grant them access to OpenAI&#39;s Deep Research , a tool that can create reports from hundreds of online sources.&nbsp; AI tools have been widely adopted by students for research and other uses, with open AI recently saying that a third of young adults aged 18-24 already use ChatGPT, with much of that directed toward studies. Anthropic is going even farther than OpenAI to tap into that market with Claude for Education, by introducing a Learning mode specifically designed to guide students to a solution, rather than providing answers outright.&nbsp; Where Anthropic is positioning itself more as a tutor to students, OpenAI is simply giving them access to its most powerful research tools. That brings up the subject of academic integrity and whether AI tools are doing work that students should be doing themselves. Anthropic&#39;s approach may be more palatable to institutions — along with its Claude for Education launch, the company announced that it partnered with several universities and colleges to make the new product free for students.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-20-chatgpt-plus-is-now-free-for-college-students-until-the-end-of-may-120037778.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Nintendo’s new console has finally been revealed in full, with magnetically attaching Joy-Cons, a new chat function and a bigger higher-res 7.9-inch screen that supports 120Hz and HDR. Then there are the new Joy-Cons. Alongside larger SL and SR buttons made of metal, the controllers can be disconnected by pressing a more pronounced release button on the back. The big upgrade, though, is using either Joy-Con like a mouse. (And even use them on your pants , if you want to.) The Switch 2 also uses DLSS, so it’s easier for developers to port games across to the hybrid console. In a very Nintendo way, it didn’t actually talk up the hardware specifics, so NVIDIA had to fill in the gaps.&nbsp; Engadget According to NVIDIA, responsible for the chip inside, the Switch 2 has “ten times” the graphical performance of the original. DLSS tech means games can be rendered at a lower resolution, and trained AI models and dedicated Tensor Cores can be used to fill in extra details. With that extra power, the Switch 2 supports up to 60 fps at 4K resolution and 120 fps at 1440p or 1080p resolutions, docked. The 1080p screen can handle variable refresh rates up to 120Hz in handheld mode, too. Yes, catching up with the last two decades, the Switch 2 can also do video chat (and voice chat, but yawn). However, it demands a sold-separately camera, costing $50. Boo. I think that strikes at the issue of price. The original Switch was $300 at launch, the PS5 starts at $399 now. The Switch 2 is $450. Sure, that includes the screen and (technically) two controllers, but it’s a bit of a jump. Is Nintendo factoring in tariffs? Possibly. While some of us think $450 is an appropriate price for the console itself, the costs are creeping up in every direction. Want the new must-have Mario Kart World ? That’s $80 now. Meanwhile, older games re-released on the Switch 2 also won't be cheap. Cyberpunk 2077 rings in at $70. Oof. If you want to expand storage, well, you’d need a microSD express card, the faster, pricier version of the tiny storage card. Need another pair of Joy-Cons? That will be $90, please. Want to pre-order a Switch 2 ahead of the June 5 launch? We’ve got all the details, but it’s worth noting Nintendo is trying to get ahead of scalpers by offering a dedicated pre-order system for existing heavy Switch users with a Switch Online subscription. In Nintendo’s words: “Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025.” Read on for our hands-on impressions of the Switch 2 . — Mat Smith Get Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox.

Nintendo While we didn’t get to try it at the early hands-on event, voice chat is an integral part of the new Nintendo console. By pressing the new C button on the right Joy-Con, players can jump into a GameChat with friends and family. Nintendo demoed the feature during its recent Switch 2 Direct, alongside a new Switch 2 Camera, enabling video chat too, with a cut-out profile.

    "title": "The best budgeting apps for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Managing your finances doesn’t have to be a headache — especially with the right budgeting app at your fingertips. Whether you’re trying to track everyday spending, save for a big purchase or just keep a closer eye on your subscriptions, there’s an app that can help. With Mint shutting down, plenty of users have been looking for the best budget apps to replace it, and luckily there are plenty of solid alternatives. From AI-powered spending trackers to apps that break down your expenses into easy-to-follow categories, the best budgeting tools help you take control of your money without the hassle of spreadsheets. Some focus on automating savings, while others give you a deep dive into your finances with powerful analytics and custom reporting. If you’re still searching for the right Mint alternative, check out our guide to the best budgeting apps to replace Mint to find the best fit for your needs. If you’re not sure where to start, we’ve rounded up the top budgeting apps to help you track spending, save smarter, and stick to your financial goals. Best budget apps of 2025 How we test budgeting apps Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. Budgeting app FAQs What is Plaid and how does it work? Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims . To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” Why did Mint shut down? When parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog . In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative , you have some decent options. What about Rocket Money? Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.

    "description": "After a January announcement that it would spend $80 billion on data center construction, Microsoft may already be adjusting its future plans. Sources told Bloomberg that Microsoft has delayed or slowed data center efforts in Indonesia, the UK, Australia, Illinois, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Some of the cases meant withdrawing from negotiations, while others have involved delays on planned construction projects, according to these insiders. These data centers would be central to Microsoft's efforts to develop more capabilities around artificial intelligence. Despite the apparent shift in its approach, a Microsoft rep told Bloomberg that the company still plans to hold to its $80 billion spending budget on data centers during its 2025 fiscal year. Engadget has reached out for confirmation and will update if we receive comment from Microsoft. That was the figure laid out in a blog post attributed to Vice-Chair and President Brad Smith. The post, published days before President Trump's inauguration, included some ingratiating language for the new administration. \"The country has a unique opportunity to pursue this vision and build on the foundational ideas set for AI policy during President Trump’s first term,\" it reads. \"At Microsoft, we are excited to take part in this journey.\" Microsoft's plans could have been influenced by looming tariffs, which had been threatened and were finally introduced this week by President Trump. The trade policy is likely to make large infrastructure plans more expensive and has already caused uncertainties on Wall Street. It could be that the company will still spend in the ballpark of $80 billion but will not be able to complete as many locations as it had previously calculated. Or it could be that in the months since presenting its forecast, Microsoft has already seen a reduction in expected demand.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-is-reportedly-walking-back-some-data-center-plans-210406748.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Traeger's only gas-powered grill is its Flatrock flat-top griddle. Besides this one model, everything else in the company's lineup runs on wood pellets . Since griddles continue to be insanely popular backyard cooking tools, Traeger is expanding its Flatrock line with a smaller, two-burner option. The Flatrock 2 Zone has all of the features from the larger version, which is now called the Flatrock 3 Zone, in a griddle that takes up less space on your deck, patio or porch.&nbsp; As the name suggests, the Flatrock 2 Zone has two separate cooking areas with precise heat control for each one. U-shaped burners consistently heat the entire cooking surface and an edge-to-edge, wind-blocking design helps keep the flame running smoothly without burnouts or flare-ups. Like the Flatrock 3 Zone, there are folding side shelves for resting tools and trays, plus the Pop-And-Lock (PAL) rail system allows you to add the snap-on accessories you need to complete your griddle setup. The EZ-Clean grease keg from other recent Traeger grills is here as well, making it easy to get rid of liquids and debris after cooking.&nbsp; Traeger The main appeal of the Flatrock 2 Zone is that it's smaller than the original model. You'll still have the ability to make breakfasts, smash burgers, fajitas and more with the griddle's 468 square inches of cooking surface, but this new version will fit better in smaller outdoor spaces. It's also $200 cheaper at $700. Unfortunately, there's no word on availability just yet: Traeger says the Flatrock 2 Zone is coming \"soon\" to its website and retailers in the US and Canada.&nbsp; If you're looking for an alternative, Weber's Slate griddles are well-built and offer various options depending on the size and features you're after. Starting at $549, you can get the three-burner, 28-inch base model that comes on a basic cart similar to the company's gas grills. Even this smallest Weber option offers more cooking area than the Flatrock 2 Zone at 504 square inches. At the top end, there's a four-burner, 36-inch version that comes with an easy-to-read digital temperature gauge and enclosed storage for $999. What's more, Weber offers a 30-inch size in between those two, with various storage configurations and an the option to include that battery-powered temperature gauge.

    "description": "Yesterday, we learned a lot about the Switch 2 we didn't know before, including the fact Nintendo that will offer a webcam alongside the new console. As far as accessories go , the $50 Switch 2 Camera looks boring, and judging from the footage the company shared on Wednesday, not particularly great at its intended purpose of, you know, capturing moving pictures.&nbsp; The good news? Nintendo is allowing third-party manufacturers to make their own webcams for the new console. Enter the Hori Piranha Plant Camera.&nbsp; Hori Hori's Switch 2 camera has a couple of features you won't find on Nintendo's first-party offering. First, the pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both as a stand and USB extension for the device. The part of the Piranha that houses the webcam can detach from the pot, allowing you to, ahem, plant it directly on the top of the Switch 2. In that way, you can take your new buddy on the road. Want to trash talk your friends over video in GameChat while on a domestic flight? With the Piranha Plant and in-flight Wi-Fi, you can.&nbsp; Second, the Piranha Plant camera has a built-in privacy shutter. You can simply close its mouth to obscure the lens. If that's not clever, functional design, I don't know what is. Hori Hori has yet to list the Piranha Plant camera on its US website, but over in Germany, retailer Media Markt has the accessory priced at €40 or €20 less than the official Switch 2 Camera from Nintendo. Practical, stylish and affordable, what's not to love?&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/horis-piranha-plant-switch-2-camera-is-a-work-of-art-194430377.html?src=rss",

    "description": "YouTube is updating the video editor for Shorts to better compete with the likes of TikTok and Instagram Reels, and teasing some AI-powered features that are coming later this year that might make it stand out. The new and improve editor will let users \"make precise adjustments and edits to the timing of each clip with zooming and snapping,\" along with the usual option to rearrange and delete your footage. YouTube says you'll also be able to add music and timed text, and preview your video at any point while you're editing. At some point in the future, the editor will gain the ability to automatically sync clips to a song. And \"later this spring,\" YouTube says the editor will be able to create stickers from photos in your image gallery or with a built-in AI image generator. As part of this update, the process of using templates is also getting simplified. Creators of templates will now be automatically credited when anyone uses their work, and templates themselves can now include things like image overlays and filter effects. YouTube is clearly trying to reach some kind of parity with the creative tools offered by TikTok and Instagram. TikTok's editing tools and the standalone CapCut video editor have long been the gold standard for creating videos on your phone. Given the uncertain future of TikTok in the US , making YouTube Shorts a more appealing alternative makes sense. It's also not the first time YouTube has drawn inspiration from TikTok. YouTube added a robotic, text-to-speech narration feature to Shorts, clearly inspired by TikTok's popular version, in 2024.

It was announced the day after President Trump decided to tariff the entire world , which put markets into a tailspin . Verizon didn’t specifically mention this policy, but did say that the move was intended to give “predictability” to its customer base. However, there are some caveats. Customers have to be enrolled in one of the company’s newer myPlan subscriptions to be eligible. Also, the guarantee only covers the base charge for the rate plan. It doesn’t do anything regarding those mysterious little fees that carriers use to raise prices on the down low .&nbsp; 🔥 BIG NEWS! 🔥 Verizon is introducing a 3-Year Price Guarantee for ALL new and existing customers on myPlan &amp; myHome, PLUS a FREE phone with trade-in and free satellite messaging!

This could force a rate hike if Verizon decides alter the discount. Of course, the company will likely try to persuade consumers to increase the monthly bill of their own accord. This carrot usually takes the shape of a “free” phone. To that end, Verizon announced it will be giving free phones to new and existing customers. This requires a suitable trade-in device and enrollment in a myPlan subscription. The three-year price lock also covers the company’s myHome 5G internet plans. Current myPlan members don’t have to do anything to start this price lock process. The enrollment is automatic. This is just the latest promotion to lure customers to its myPlan subscriptions.

    "description": "This week's Nintendo Direct provided much more info about the Switch 2 but didn't go too deep into the nitty-gritty details of what powers the console. That left NVIDIA, the Mario maker's hardware partner on the console's processor and GPU, to fill in some blanks with a blog post published on Thursday — including the first confirmation that it uses Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) tech . NVIDIA said the Switch 2's DLSS support helps to give the console \"ten times\" the graphical performance of the original Switch. The tech lets games render games in a lower resolution, then uses trained AI models and dedicated Tensor Cores to fill in detail. Saying a system has ten times the graphics performance is likely a simplified marketing claim, and its graphical prowess could vary greatly depending on the title. The console has also yet to be scrutinized with extended real-world use. However, in Engadget's Sam Rutherford hands-on , he found that the system handled the new Switch 2 versions of Street Fighter 6 , Cyberpunk 2077 and Civilization 7 well, with all running \"really smooth.\" Sam Rutherford for Engadget In docked mode, the Switch 2 supports up to 60fps at 4K resolution or 120fps at 1440p or 1080p resolutions. In handheld mode, the 7.9-inch, 1080p screen supports a variable refresh rate (via G-Sync ) of up to 120Hz. \"The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,\" NVIDIA explained. \"Tensor Cores power AI-driven features like Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality. Tensor Cores also enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, enhancing social gaming and streaming.\" For more on the new system, check out Engadget's Switch 2 hands-on and deep dive into everything we know about it.

Her account has resurfaced information about Facebook’s attempts to operate in China, and revealed new details about its overtures to Chinese government officials. “We do not operate our services in China today. It is no secret we were once interested in doing so as part of Facebook’s effort to connect the world,” Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said in a statement. “This was widely reported beginning a decade ago. We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored, which Mark Zuckerberg announced in 2019.\" Prior to her book’s publication, Wynn-Williams also filed whistleblower complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice about alleged misconduct at the company.

    "description": "The original Switch started a revolution when it combined the portability of handhelds with the ability to play games on your TV at home like a traditional console. But with the Nintendo Switch 2 , even though it's physically bigger, it feels like a sleeker, faster and more refined take on its predecessor — to the point that Nintendo should have called it the Super Switch (which apparently almost happened ). And after getting a chance to try it out, I'm sold on its abilities, even with its significantly higher starting price of $450. Editor's note: This hands-on focuses on our writer's experience with the new Nintendo Switch 2, covering the hardware, playing experience and changes from the original model. If you're looking for more info on Sam's impressions of individual games, start with his hands-on with Mario Kart World , which he calls a \"perfect launch game for the Switch 2.\" Design and display: No OLED, no problem The Switch 2 has the same basic shape and layout as the original, including its signature detachable Joy-Con. But it looks more polished all around, thanks to tapered edges and slimmer bezels. Nintendo also increased the size of its joystick caps and the face buttons on the left controller, though the latter still doesn't feel quite like a traditional D-pad. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, the biggest upgrade is its larger 7.9-inch 1080p LCD display, which now supports a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and high dynamic range. Frankly, it's super bright and very colorful to the point where I don't really miss having an OLED screen. Now there's a fair bit of grumbling that Nintendo, despite the existence of the OLED Switch, didn't opt for a similar panel type on the Switch 2. But if you remember, that model didn't support HDR, so it's not like we're looking at a downgrade in display quality, though the super deep blacks you get from OLED screens would have been nice. Also, the Switch 2 feels like it defies its dimensions because even though its display is larger than the 6.2-inch version on the base Switch, it doesn't feel that much bigger. It's only half an inch taller (4.5 inches) and a little over an inch wider (9.4 vs 10.7 inches). And while its weight has also increased to 1.18 pounds with its Joy-Con attached (up from 0.88 pounds), it never felt too heavy. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Elsewhere, there are a ton of quality-of-life upgrades, including a second USB-C port (though the one on the bottom is the only one that can do video out), a built-in mic and support for microSD Express cards. That last one is a big deal, because even though the cards are more expensive, they're also significantly faster than your standard fare and they should be a major boon to download speeds and load times. I admit the lack of analog shoulder buttons is a small downer, though Nintendo says it made that choice because analog buttons would introduce a tiny bit of input lag and it wanted to go with the more responsive solution. Joy-Con features: Expanded detachables During its livestream, Nintendo spent a lot of time talking about the C button on the right Joy-Con, which feels like a first-party solution that looks to recreate everything people like about Discord. But at Nintendo's hands-on experience, there weren't any chances to test out the console's new social features, so I wasn't able to dive deeper into that. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That's ok, though, because I think the Joy-Con's new magnetic mounting system is the hidden star. Not only is there a larger button around back for popping them off, they now detach simply when you pull them left or right. There's no need to slide anything up or down first. Granted, this sounds like a small change, but it makes the whole process so much simpler and the Joy-con seem to be more securely attached as well. Then there's the Joy-Con's ability to function as a mouse (for both the left and right controllers). I thought it was pretty gimmicky, until I played Metroid Prime 4: Beyond &nbsp; where I suddenly found myself favoring the mouse mode over standard gamepad controls. Everything feels a bit more precise and if you're a fan of shooters on PC, it's definitely worth trying out. The obvious limitation is that while you can use the Joy-Con on your leg, you really ought to have some sort of flat surface like a table, which may not be an option if your favorite place to game is on the couch. Performance: Nintendo's move to next-gen tech Sam Rutherford for Engadget Nintendo has kept relatively quiet regarding the Switch 2's processor and memory. But the company has said the system does support DLSS and hardware-based ray tracing. Now those features might not get used in every game, but it does seem to make it way easier for third-party developers to port their titles over to the company's upcoming console. When I played the new Switch 2 versions of Street Fighter 6 , Cyberpunk 2077 and Civilization 7 , they all ran really smooth. And without doing a straight-up side-by-side comparison next to a proper gaming PC, it was really hard to tell if the Switch 2 was cutting corners graphically, if it was even doing it at all. The only hiccup I noticed was rather long loading times in Civ , which isn't exactly uncommon for a Sid Meier game. The flipside to this is if you told me that some of Nintendo's new first-party games like Donkey Kong Bananza and Mario Kart World were actually being run on an original Switch, I wouldn't have blinked. In some ways, Nintendo's ability to wring every last bit of performance out of its hardware and its habit of eschewing hyperrealism in favor of more stylized graphics has almost put a ceiling on the company's ability to really show off its chops. But when you pay attention, you'll really appreciate how delightfully satiny Mario Kart looks when it's running at 120 fps. I still have questions about what's going on inside the Switch 2's new dock and how it's leveraging its increased performance to deliver 4K resolutions when connected to a TV. I also think it's a travesty that Nintendo is charging money for the Switch 2 Welcome Tour. It's barely a game, but it is a genuinely useful way to introduce the console's features to new owners and it really should be pre-installed on every system for free. It also remains to be seen how the Switch 2's battery life holds up. Nintendo says it has a larger power pack than the original Switch, but it also has increased performance and a larger screen, while the company claims runtimes may vary between two and six and half hours depending on the title.&nbsp; But all told, the Switch 2 is exactly what you want from a successor to Nintendo's legendary hybrid console. Aside from the price, that is, because in addition to the console starting at $450, almost all of its standard accessories cost more than before, too. From the Pro Controller, which now goes for $80 ($10 more than for the original Switch) or additional pairs of Joy-Con that cost $90 (another $10 hike). And that's before you factor in the cost of games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza that start at $80 and $70 as digital downloads (or $90 and $80 if you want physical carts).

    "description": "TikTok will reportedly face a fine of over €500 million ($553 million) for transferring Europeans' private data to China. Bloomberg said on Thursday that Ireland's data protection commission, which regulates TikTok owner ByteDance's EU operations, could dish out the penalty before the end of April. The fine results from a four-year investigation of TikTok's data handling practices. The probe reportedly concluded that ByteDance broke Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws by transferring private user data to China to be accessed by engineers. The country is known for its widespread, high-tech surveillance . \"TikTok tells us that EU data is transferred to the U.S. and not to China, however we have understood that there is possibility that maintenance and AI engineers in China may be accessing data,\" former Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon said in March 2021 when the probe began. Ireland is taking the lead because, under the GDPR, the country where a company's European operations are located oversees compliance and enforcement. ByteDance's European headquarters are in Dublin. Bloomberg says the decision date and amount of the fine aren't yet finalized and could still change. Of course, this isn't even ByteDance's biggest drama unfolding this week. The fate of TikTok's US operations hangs in the balance as it approaches an April 5 deadline to find a buyer or face a ban in America . The list of likely outcomes ranges from finding a buyer (Amazon has even thrown its hat in the ring ) to its US investors rolling over their stakes into a new independent global company or the deadline passing with another deadline extension .

    "description": "Engineers at Northwestern University have developed the world’s smallest pacemaker . It’s so small, as a matter of fact, that it fits inside the tip of a syringe. This means that it’s injectable, so patients could potentially avoid a painful surgery. It safely dissolves into the bloodstream after a time, so it’s a temporary solution. It’s designed for folks who need heart help on a short-term basis, like newborn babies with congenital defects. However, it can work with hearts of all sizes. It’s also powered by light, which is pretty darned cool. The pacemaker is paired with a wireless wearable device that mounts to a patient’s chest. When that small device detects an irregular heartbeat, it shines a light that activates the pacemaker. These light pulses can penetrate a patient’s skin, bones and muscles. Even though the pacemaker is tiny, measuring one millimeter in thickness, it still delivers as much stimulation as a full-sized unit. The engineers published their findings in Nature and noted that the device works with both animal and human hearts. The team also reiterated that pediatric care is the primary use case here. “About one percent of children are born with congenital heart defects,” said Northwestern experimental cardiologist Igor Efimov, who co-led the study. “The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical. Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device. And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.” The development of this medical device was co-led by John Rogers, which is a familiar name in biomedical circles. Rogers has been behind a number of astounding innovations throughout the years. He’s advanced technology that could eventually give us invisibility cloaks and health-tracking tattoos . He also built a thumbnail-sized UV sensor and a circuit that dissolves in the body . That last one eventually led to this innovative pacemaker. Rogers imagines a world in which physicians inject a number of these pacemakers simultaneously, to enable sophisticated synchronization. This could help terminate arrhythmias, as different parts of the heart could be paced at unique rhythms. “Because it’s so small, this pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device,” Rogers said. “Here, the tiny pacemakers can be activated as necessary to address complications that can occur during a patient’s recovery process.” This versatility could eventually open up a diverse array of medical possibilities. The tech could be used to help nerves heal, treat wounds and block pain.

    "description": "Nintendo just held a livestream to drop more details on the forthcoming Switch 2 console. At the very end, it revealed a brand-new 3D platformer starring Donkey Kong. This is the first game of its type since Donkey Kong 64 hit the Nintendo 64 all the way back in 1999. It’s called Donkey Kong Bananza and launches exclusively for the Switch 2 on July 17, which is just over a month after the console hits store shelves. It looks cool! Much of the environment is destructible, so DK can get in there and break stuff. It also features sidescrolling segments, sort of like how modern Mario 3D platformers dip into their 2D roots every once in a while. We got to try it out in our hands-on with the Switch 2 , and while it looks fabulous, it also feels like the kind of game that would have looked great on the original Switch. With Nintendo&#39;s stylized graphics for titles like this, the impact of the Switch 2&#39;s upgrades doesn&#39;t quite hit the same way it might in other games. That&#39;s not a big knock, but just something to be aware of. The whole thing has a funky and cartoonish vibe one would expect from our favorite gorilla. However, I didn’t hear one lick of the famous Donkey Kong rap during the trailer but the equally iconic &quot;ooh banana&quot; sound effect from DK64 does make a brief cameo. The trailer does show DK climbing up the sides of mountains (getting his BOTW -era Link on) and rollicking through several locations. These include a forest and an ice region, among others. The footage also shows the meanest looking Kong I’ve ever seen. Nintendo We don’t know too much about this game beyond what the trailer shows, but we don’t have that long to wait. Once again, Donkey Kong Bananza comes out on July 17. Update: April 3 2025, 10:10AM ET: Updated with a few impressions from our Switch 2 hands-on demo.

    "description": "What do modern speakers need? Good sound quality? As little distortion as possible? Longevity? Well, yes. Plus, according to Bang &amp; Olufsen , marble plinths. Bang &amp; Olufsen is debuting a partnership with Italian marble and granite company Antolini at Milan Design Week. The Beosound Balance Natura speaker features a sculptural base from Antolini that the audio company says elevates the device to its optimal height. Apparently, the plinth isn't just there for aesthetic — it's a functional audio element. Let's face it, though: You wouldn't buy a speaker with a marble stand unless you wanted that marble pedestal. And that is why they're making the model available with various Antolini stones. You can get it with natural quartz, as well as with petrified wood and fossilized wood, if you're looking for something with earthy colors. The options have different translucency and color depth, but one common feature is the anodized aluminum ring that serves as the transition between the plinth and the bottom of the speaker.&nbsp; In addition to the Natura version of the Beosound Balance speaker, Bang &amp; Olufsen is also presenting a Beovision Theatre 55-inch TV and a pair of Beolab 28 speakers customized with Antolini's Amazon quartite at Milan Design Week. All the products it's showcasing during the event are made to order with prices available upon request, which says all you need to know about its price range, especially since the basic Beosound Balance isn't cheap to begin with and will set you back $3,300 .

    "description": "Following recent tests , Amazon is finally ready to launch its Project Kuiper space internet project in a bid to rival Elon Musk&#39;s Starlink, the company announced. The first batch of 27 satellites on the KA-01 (Kuiper Atlas 1) mission are set to launch into low earth orbit (LEO) aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on April 9th next week from Cape Canaveral if conditions allow. Amazon hopes to start offering the high-speed internet service &quot;later this year,&quot; it said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon&#39;s network will eventually comprise 3,200 satellites launched from partners including ULA, Arianespace, Blue Origin and even SpaceX. Much like that company&#39;s Starlink, Project Kuiper&#39;s service will cover the entire planet when completed. It will work with a dish as small as seven inches that will deliver speeds up to 100Mbps, smaller than Starlink&#39;s Mini , or up to 1Gbps with larger dishes. The company said the cost of terminals will be under $400.&nbsp; The satellites will cruise at 17,000 mph at 392 miles above earth, circling the planet in about 90 minutes. They&#39;ll use a dialectic mirror film coating that&#39;s supposed to scatter light and make them less visible to ground-based astronomers, Amazon said. SpaceX&#39;s constellation currently uses over 7,000 satellites, so the Project Kuiper and Starlink fleet will use over 10,000 LEO satellites once Amazon&#39;s network is complete.&nbsp; Amazon Amazon launched two test satellites in October 2023 and proclaimed its early tests a success, with the pair sending and retrieving data at speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second. Later in December, it bolstered the network with a network of high-speed laser cross-links that promise further speed boosts. The company claims its mesh network can move data about 30 percent faster than terrestrial fiber optic cables.&nbsp; Project Kuiper’s first launch will be the heaviest payload yet for the Atlas V, which will fly in its most powerful configuration. The rocket will include five solid rocket boosters in addition to the main booster, and a payload fairing 77 feet high and 16.4 feet wide. Despite past successful tests, the mission isn&#39;t without risk. &quot;We’ve done extensive testing on the ground to prepare for this first mission, but there are some things you can only learn in flight, and this will be the first time we’ve flown our final satellite design and the first time we’ve deployed so many satellites at once,&quot; Project Kuiper vice president Rajeev Badyal wrote. &quot;No matter how the mission unfolds, this is just the start of our journey, and we have all the pieces in place to learn and adapt as we prepare to launch again and again over the coming years.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-will-start-launching-its-project-kuiper-starlink-rival-next-week-123011012.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikons-z5-ii-is-the-cheapest-full-frame-camera-yet-with-internal-raw-video-113041486.html?src=rss",
    "description": "After years of lagging behind rivals when it comes to video capture (and then suddenly buying cinema camera manufacturer RED), Nikon is pushing new boundaries in that area. Its latest salvo is the $1,699 24-megapixel full-frame Z5 II , perhaps the cheapest mirrorless camera so far to support internal RAW video. It also offers improved autofocus with new AI powers, cleaner images and enhanced image stabilization.&nbsp; The Z5 II is a wholesale remake of the original Z5 and that starts with video. While still limited to 4K 30 fps and cropped 4K 60 fps, it can now capture those formats internally using the company's 12-bit N-RAW format with N-log, along with 10-bit H.265 and 8-bit H.264. Interestingly, it will record in N-RAW to SDXC UHS-II cards, since the camera lacks high-speed CFexpress slots. That likely means you'll need to buy very fast ( and expensive ) cards and that the N-RAW video will be highly compressed. Still, it's a feature available on no other camera in this price range.&nbsp; Nikon Nikon is also promising much-improved autofocus bolstered by a new image-processing engine and tech borrowed from its high-end Z9 and Z8 models. The Z5 II can now lock onto subjects more quickly, particularly human eyes, faces and bodies, and works in lower light down to -10 EV, compared to -3 EV before. Meanwhile, the AI system can detect up to nine subject types ranging from animals (including a Bird Detection mode) to bicycles. When working in Auto-Area AF, these subjects can be detected, focused on, and tracked automatically.&nbsp; Native ISOs have been boosted to 100-64000 (50-204,800 in expanded modes), up from a maximum 51,200 before. That should improve noise levels across the ISO ranges, the company said. However, resolution is still limited to 24 megapixels.&nbsp; Nikon In-body stabilization has been boosted to 7.5 stops with supported lenses, way up from five stops on the Z5. That's paired with electronic stabilization designed to keep handheld video steady.&nbsp; The Z5 II's viewfinder still offers a decent 3.69-million dots of resolution, but brightness has been boosted to 3,000 nits with 13 levels of brightness control. And it now comes with a 1.7-million-dot vari-angle display that's a big improvement from the previous model's tilt-only screen. The body now has a deeper grip to improve handling and comes with a one-touch Picture Control button for previewing and switching between color profiles in real time, matching a recent trend started by Fujifilm's X100 VI. Other features including dual SD UHS-II card slots, 3.5mm headphone and mic jacks, camera to cloud connectivity via Nikon's Imaging Cloud and a new weather-proof build \"on par with the Z6 III,\" according to Nikon.&nbsp; The Z5 II looks to be an impressive hybrid full-frame camera for the money and rivals Sony and Canon don't really have anything in the same price range that can match it. However, it also comes at a price $300 higher than the Z5 was at launch. Still, it could tempt filmmakers and others away from similarly priced crop sensor cameras from the likes of Fujifilm and Sony. The Z5 II is now on pre-order for $1,699 (body only) or $1,999 with a 24-50mm f/4-6.3 kit lens .&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikons-z5-ii-is-the-cheapest-full-frame-camera-yet-with-internal-raw-video-113041486.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best smartwatches for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Smartwatches do more than just track your steps and deliver phone alerts to your wrist. The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone. Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches , fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks. Table of contents Best smartwatches Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Other smartwatches our experts tested Smartwatch FAQs Best smartwatches of 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Fossil Yes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil , Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. Ultimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please. Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Compatibility Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone. The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things. Price The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have. Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials. Battery life Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates. Communication Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now. Fitness tracking Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well. Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more. Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege. Music Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds. Displays Most wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives. You won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again. NFC Many new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth. Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems. Other smartwatches our experts tested Apple Watch Ultra 2 The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Apple Watch SE The Apple Watch SE is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. You’ll get all the core Apple Watch features as well as things like fall and crash detection, noise monitoring and Emergency SOS, but you’ll have to do without more advanced hardware perks like an always-on display, a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG monitor and a skin temperature sensor. Garmin Forerunner 745 Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay. Smartwatch FAQs Is there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker? While smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes. A fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind. A smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases. If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice. How long do smartwatches last? How long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability. Smartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster. Physically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support. You can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary. How much should you spend on a smartwatch? How much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it. If you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps. In the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two. High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features. If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value. Do all smartwatches have GPS? Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking. High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone. Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind. Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking. Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch? Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone. If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost. Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices. If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience. Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone? Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features. Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE. If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work. Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications. If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker. What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch? The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration. Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch. Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby. In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model. If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge. Georgie Peru contributed to this report.

    "description": "TikTok may be back online and in app stores, but its future in the United States is still far from certain. President Donald Trump’s executive order delaying enforcement of the ban was only a temporary reprieve for the company and the clock is once again running out on a potential ban. While ByteDance was once resistant to the idea of selling TikTok’s US business, that seems to have changed since Trump took office. A ByteDance investor said early this year that striking a deal to keep TikTok in the US is “in everybody's interest.\" Officials in China also suggested they were “open” to a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal . A number of people and companies have signaled some interest in TikTok. Trump himself has said he would like to see a “bidding war” for the app and that the US government should own a stake in the company. What an eventual deal may look like, though, is unclear. These are the offers we currently know about. On March 9, Trump said the administration was \"dealing with four different groups\" on a potential deal, though he didn't name names.&nbsp; Trump’s executive order gave the company 75 days to come to an agreement, though he has recently said he would \"probably\" extend the deadline if a deal isn't reached by April 5. Oracle + new US investors NPR reported in January that Oracle was working with Trump Administration officials on “a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's global operations.” Under this arrangement, ByteDance “would retain a minority stake in the company” but Oracle would oversee “the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates.” Recent reports suggest that a new investors, including Silicon Valley heavyweight Andreesen Horowitz, would join TikTok's existing US investors to form a new entity. It could be called \"TikTok America,\" according to a report in The Information. This option is likely appealing because it wouldn't require a new owner to attempt to re-architect the app's algorithm and because TikTok has an existing partnership with Oracle. The cloud company already hosts TikTok’s US user data and the company was a key part of TikTok’s original negotiations to remain operational in the US under a plan called Project Texas. (Those negotiations abruptly fell apart in 2022.) Trump also previously signed off on a deal for Oracle and Walmart to acquire a 20 percent stake in TikTok in 2020, when the president tried to ban the app during his first term. That deal never materialized. Microsoft Microsoft is reportedly also interested in playing a role in TikTok’s future, according to the same NPR story, which said Microsoft was among the “other potential investors” involved in the talks with Oracle. Trump seemingly confirmed this. When asked directly if Microsoft was interested in buying TikTok, Trump responded “I would say yes.” As with Oracle, this isn’t the first time Microsoft has attempted to acquire the social media company. Microsoft was in talks to buy TikTok in 2020 and take over its US business, but the deal abruptly fell apart . Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as “the strangest thing I’ve ever sort of worked on.” Perplexity AI&nbsp; Just before TikTok briefly went offline , Perplexity AI threw its hat into the ring, offering a deal to ByteDance that “would “create a new entity combining Perplexity, TikTok US and New Capital Partners.” Since then, Perplexity has tweaked its proposal. The company put out a detailed plan outlining how it would rebuild the app's core recommendation algorithm, integrate shortform videos into its search engine and bring a Community Notes-like fact checking feature to the service.&nbsp; Project Liberty Another set of investors that’s proposed a bid to buy TikTok is a group known as Project Liberty . Led by investor Frank McCourt, it includes Kevin O’Leary of Shark Tank fame. The group initially came forward before the ban took effect. In March, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian announced that he was joining the Project Liberty bid to acquire TikTok's assets. \"I'd love to see an app where users actually own their data and where creators have real control,\" he wrote in a short post on X that hinted at a potential tie-in with... the blockchain. \"Imagine bringing all those users seamlessly onchain...\" An accompanying video referenced the possibility of \"decentralized distribution,\" but didn't offer details. O’Leary previously told CNBC that deals involving a government stake may not comply with the law. “That 50/50 deal, I would love to work with Trump on, so would every other potential buyer ... But the problem with some of these ideas is they are inconsistent with the ruling of the Supreme Court,” he said. “I would love to do a deal, if the law provided for it, but I don’t have the luxury of breaching the order of Congress.” Later, he said that the deal \"changes by the hour,\" writing on X that \"it's clear to me now that we're going to have to do a dance between the original owners, the founders of ByteDance itself, and interpreting the law of what Congress and Supreme Court has upheld.\" MrBeast YouTuber MrBeast, also known as Jimmy Donaldson, joked on X about buying TikTok ahead of the initial ban. He later said that “so many billionaires” had reached out to him about making an offer that he was going to try to actually pull it off. Okay fine, I’ll buy Tik Tok so it doesn’t get banned — MrBeast (@MrBeast) January 14, 2025 At least one group has already confirmed his involvement, along with other “high-net-worth individuals” looking to make an “all-cash offer.” That group, led by employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley also reportedly includes Roblox CEO David Baszucki. According to Bloomberg , together they have put together “significantly” more than $20 billion for a bid, though it’s not clear how seriously their offer is being considered. Bloomberg noted that there’s also a possibility that MrBeast may attach himself to other bids. Amazon Amazon reportedly made a last-ditch bid to buy TikTok, according to reports in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. The online retailer reportedly approached Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about the offer, which doesn't seem to be under serious consideration. Amazon declined to comment on the reports. AppLovin Another company to make a last-minute offer is AppLovin, a Silicon Valley company that makes software for app developers. The Wall Street Journal reported that the firm also has backing from Steve Wynn, a casino mogul and Trump donor. \"AppLovin’s pitch to the Trump administration, which would be funded by Wynn, was that it could solve national security concerns and unleash economic growth as a job creator,\" The WSJ reported. OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely Yet another eleventh hour bid for TikTok reportedly comes from OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely. Reuters reports that Stokely (via a startup he runs called Zoop) partnered with the Hbar Foundation, a cryptocurrency firm, to bid on TikTok.&nbsp; \"Our bid for TikTok isn't just about changing ownership, it's about creating a new paradigm where both creators and their communities benefit directly from the value they generate,\" one of Zoop's executives told the publication. pic.twitter.com/bQNcWYJ2tD — HBAR Foundation (@HBAR_foundation) April 2, 2025 What’s next? So where does all this leave TikTok? For now, the company is still in limbo. Even if a tentative deal is announced ahead of the April 5 deadline, ByteDance and Chinese officials would also need to sign off on any agreement in order for it to move forward. Update, March 10, 2025, 6:55PM ET: This story has been updated to add new statements from President Trump, as well as to add details about Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian joining the Project Liberty bid. Update, April 2, 2025, 6:47PM ET: This story has been updated with new information regarding proposals involving Oracle and Perplexity AI. It's also been updated to reflect reported bids from Amazon, AppLovin and OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely.

    "description": "The Switch 2 is bigger, more powerful and more expensive than the original Switch, but the tech specs for the new console reveal at least one key way it's worse: The Switch 2's battery life is shorter. Nintendo says that battery life on the Switch 2 varies depending on the game you play, but that it estimates the console should last approximately \"2 – 6.5 hours.\" That's notably shorter than the battery life you'll get out of a current Switch or Switch OLED, based on the company's support page . Nintendo estimates that a Switch OLED \"with a serial number that starts with 'XT'\" should last around \"4.5 to 9 hours.\" Non-OLED Switch consoles \"with a serial number that starts with 'XK'\" are expected to last the same amount of time. Even the original Switch, which has \"a serial number that starts with 'XA',\" gets a minimum of 2.5 hours of battery life. Apparently, the extra power of the Switch 2 comes with a price. Nintendo's tech specs confirm a few other notable details. The Switch 2 supports Wi-Fi 6, which should mean you'll get faster internet speeds when the console isn't docked and connected over ethernet. Based on Nintendo's guarantee that the console \"supports 120 fps when 1920x1080/2560x1440 resolutions are selected,\" it seems like the Switch 2 won't support HDMI 2.1. As far as controllers are concerned, Amiibo support remains, but if you have special place in your heart for the Wii-esque motion controls you could use on the original Switch, it looks like you're out of luck on the Switch 2. Neither the left or right Joy-Con 2 controllers have an IR sensor, one of the ways Nintendo tracked motion on the Wii and Switch. That doesn't mean you can't use motion controls on the Switch 2, just that Nintendo isn't using IR to make them work. (At least in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond , it seems like \"mouse control\" fills the role motion controls used to on older games.)&nbsp; Do any of these changes dramatically alter the calculus on whether the Switch 2 is worth buying? Maybe not, but it is interesting to see some of the compromises and decisions Nintendo made to offer what is effectively \"the Switch, but better.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-battery-life-is-shorter-than-the-current-switch-211753028.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-arrives-on-june-5-at-450-140642208.html?src=rss",
    "description": "At last, we have the critical info millions of gamers have awaited for years: the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, price and other details about the new system. The console will arrive on June 5 and it costs $450. Pre-orders will open on April 9 , so you have a week to break open your piggy bank. The June release date confirms the long-standing rumors that had percolated since Nintendo first revealed the details of the new console in January. As suspected, it dovetails with the series of roadshow events Nintendo is holding around the globe to let folks try the Switch 2 for the first time . Those wrap up in early June. It&#39;s been reported that Nintendo wanted to have as many units of the console ready to sell out of the gate as possible to mitigate shortages. The Switch 2 is likely to be in high demand, even though Nintendo plans to keep releasing new games for the original Switch (which has sold more than 150 million units) into at least 2026. Still, if the demand is robust enough and reports that Nintendo has between 6 million and 8 million units ready to go hold true, the company is poised to smash sales records with the Switch 2. Nintendo Switch 2 hardware Nintendo says it redesigned the system from the ground up. As expected, the Nintendo Switch 2 is larger than its predecessor. It measures 7.9 inches, compared with 6.2 inches for the original system, though no thicker than the previous console. The Switch 2 has around double the pixel density of the original Switch, Nintendo says, as it has a 1080p display. In docked mode, you&#39;ll be able to play at up to 4K on your TV. There&#39;s some great news for frame rate appreciators, as the system will support up to 120Hz gameplay on its own screen. There&#39;s HDR support too. Sadly, it&#39;s an LCD display rather than an OLED. Nintendo says it improved the speakers to deliver clearer audio, while you&#39;ll be able to enjoy 3D audio in select games through compatible surround sound systems or headphones. There&#39;s a built-in mic with voice cancelling tech too (more on that in a moment). Some other hardware features had already been revealed, including the multi-angled kickstand and dual USB-C ports, either of which can be used for charging.&nbsp; Gratefully, Nintendo has given the Switch 2&#39;s internal storage a serious upgrade. At 256GB, it has eight times the built-in storage of the Switch. That was a necessary change, as many games already weighed in at over 32GB and required a microSD card to install locally.&nbsp; To add more storage, you&#39;ll need a microSD Express card, which supports higher-speed data transfers. Regular microSD cards won&#39;t be supported. As for the physical game cards, they&#39;re the same size and shape as the ones for the Nintendo Switch.&nbsp; As is usually the case, Nintendo isn&#39;t saying much about the processor or graphics processing hardware. The company simply notes that the &quot;Nintendo Switch 2 has significantly improved CPU and GPU performance over Nintendo Switch, resulting in faster processing speed and enabling new visually advanced gameplay. It also makes it possible to achieve more detailed graphics and faster loading times.&quot; Unfortunately, battery performance isn&#39;t anything to write home about. Nintendo says the Switch 2 will get between 2 and 6.5 hours of playtime, depending of course on what games you&#39;re using and if you&#39;re using online features. Speaking of online, the Switch 2 has been upgraded to Wi-Fi 6. The new dock has a built-in fan to keep the console cool and maintain stable performance. That&#39;s something that might come in handy if you&#39;re playing, say, Elden Ring on the Switch 2 — which is something you&#39;ll actually be able to do. Nintendo is promising a swatch of new accessibility features on the Switch 2. These include the option to change the font size, a speech-to-text function in GameChat (which we&#39;ll get to momentarily) and a screen reader. To help you get to grips with all of the new features of this console, you&#39;ll be able to check out tech demos, minigames and more in Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour . This will be a day-one paid launch title for the system. Explore the new system through tech demos, minigames, and quizzes with Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a paid downloadable launch title for #NintendoSwitch2 . #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com/doZVYS0wjV — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 2, 2025 Joy-Con 2 The rumors were true, the Joy-Con 2 includes a mouse control feature . Each controller can be used as a mouse, so you can maybe expect more strategy games (oh hi, Civilization VII ) and even first-person shooters — Nintendo is adding this feature just in time for Microsoft to start bringing Call of Duty games to its systems . A new 3 vs. 3 sports game called Drag x Drive, which will arrive this summer, uses the mouse controls of both Joy-Cons. The controllers attach to the main unit magnetically. To detach them, you need to press release buttons on the rear. The control sticks are larger, as are the SL and SR buttons. The latter are made of steel, and these are what the magnets built into the system attach to, seemingly electromagnetically. It is not yet clear if the Joy-Cons from the Switch will be compatible with the Switch 2 or, if so, how they&#39;d attach. So if you have a large collection of Joy-Cons, they may soon be gathering dust. Elsewhere, a new Pro controller with rear, assignable buttons will also be available. It has an audio jack and, like the Joy-Con 2, it has a C button. About that... C button and GameChat The much-discussed new C button on the right Joy-Con 2 (and the new Pro controller) can control a new feature called GameChat . For one thing, it can activate voice chat with up to 12 people.&nbsp; The microphone that&#39;s built into the main Switch 2 unit can pick up your voice from across a room when the console is in docked mode, Nintendo says. Through GameChat, the option to share your gameplay with up to four friends, so you can all see what each other is doing (though these friend streams seemed to be running at a low frame rate in Nintendo&#39;s Switch 2 Direct). A camera accessory will allow you to jump into video chat with up to four buds. You can choose to superimpose your camera feed over your gameplay. The camera will be available on the Switch 2 launch day. GameChat will require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription in the long run, but access will be free until March 31, 2026. Parents and guardians can set GameChat restrictions through the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app. The company says it has safety features in place for GameChat. Nintendo Switch 2 games Of course, Nintendo unveiled several Switch 2 games, including Mario Kart World , the new title it teased in the console&#39;s announcement video. That will be a Switch 2 launch title. Expect more details about that during a dedicated Direct on April 17. I&#39;m very excited about Donkey Kong Bananza , a 3D platformer that will hit Switch 2 on July 17. A Donkey Kong game with destructible environments just feels right. On top of that, Kirby Air Riders, a racing game from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate director Masahiro Sakurai, is coming later this year. A wave of major third-party games are coming to Switch 2 on launch day , including Cyberpunk 2077, Split Fiction, Hitman World of Assassination and Street Fighter 6. Also coming to Switch 2 at some point are Hades II, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Borderlands 4, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition (an ironically very funny name for a game that&#39;s being ported to a lass-powerful console), EA Sports FC, Project 007 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 . We got an update on a little game called Hollow Knight: Silksong, which now has a 2025 release window . Grand Theft Auto 6 better watch its back.&nbsp; In a major surprise, Nintendo revealed a brand new FromSoftware game that&#39;s coming exclusively to the Switch 2 in 2026. It&#39;s called The Duskbloods and it looks very much like a spiritual successor to Bloodborne . Meanwhile, the Switch 2 version of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack will include a library of GameCube games , such as F-Zero GX , The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and SoulCalibur II. A version of the GameCube controller will soon be available. And yes, it has a C button for GameChat. In addition, several first-party Switch games will be enhanced on the Switch 2 — but only if you shell out for a paid upgrade. These include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Super Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land, as well as the upcoming Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Transitioning from the Switch Players will be able to carry over most of their purchased Switch games, Nintendo Switch Online memberships and so on to the new console thanks to the Switch 2&#39;s backward compatibility. A new system that will also be available on the upcoming hybrid aims to make it easier for people to lend digital Switch games to friends and family but, as is so often the case with Nintendo, the company made things more complicated than they ought to be . Thankfully, Nintendo is looking to make it easy to transition from a Switch to a Switch 2. You&#39;ll be able to transfer your games, save data and so on directly to the new console. A GameShare feature will allow people to play the same Switch 2 game locally on multiple systems without having to purchase it more than once. That&#39;s a really nice quality of life upgrade for families and friends who like to play games together. Switch 2 owners can invite those using a Switch to play GameShare titles with them too. On the downside, GameShare will only be available for select games, including Super Mario Odyssey for those who really want to play as Kappy on their own device. Naturally, it&#39;ll also work on some Switch 2-exclusive games This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-arrives-on-june-5-at-450-140642208.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/gamechat-is-decades-late-and-looks-pretty-janky-202309823.html?src=rss",
    "description": "In 2002, Microsoft launched Xbox Live with built-in voice chat as one of the main selling points of the then new service. Now, nearly 25 years later, Nintendo is finally giving its fans an easy way to talk to their friends online over a friendly match of Mario Kart World . Considering some of the solutions Nintendo has offered in the past , GameChat is surprisingly elegant. A tap of the Switch 2 &#39;s new C button, conveniently located below the Home button on the right Joy-Con, brings up a dedicated interface that allows you to quickly start screensharing, mute and unmute your mic and, if you decide to buy the optional Switch 2 Camera , enable video. What&#39;s more, the Switch 2 has a built-in mic. We&#39;ll need to test the handheld to see how well the microphone performs in a noisy environment; Nintendo touted its noise-reduction features in today&#39;s introduction. But if nothing else, kudos to Nintendo for realizing it couldn&#39;t release a new console in 2025 without voice chat built-in and making that feature standard on all models. However, if the demo Nintendo showed off today is any indication of the final product, the company has some work to do. Voice chat looks like it works well enough, with users allowed to invite up to 11 other people to join their conversation. That said, screen sharing and video chat look very rough.&nbsp; When everyone in the video started streaming their gameplay, it looked like the games were running at less than 30 frames per second, making it difficult to see how it would be possible to use the feature to guide a friend through a tricky section, like Nintendo suggested in the demo. Video chat was equally janky, with the footage from the Switch 2 Camera looking like something captured by a webcam from the mid-aughts. Moreover, if you want to see your friend&#39;s screen, there&#39;s an additional tradeoff.&nbsp; Nintendo showed off three different interface options, with two of them devoting a fair amount of screen space to tiles for your friends. I imagine this won&#39;t be a problem if you&#39;re playing on a TV, but even on the Switch 2&#39;s large 7.9-inch screen, the interface looks like it could get cramped fast. To Nintendo&#39;s credit, the company has thought a lot about parental controls, with features that allow parents and guardians to decide who their kids can chat with online and if they can join a session with video. But the thing is none of GameChat’s capabilities are new. They&#39;ve existed in apps like Discord for years, which begs the question why some of them look so rough this close to launch. Nintendo has time between now and June 5 to polish GameChat, but in 2025, making a technically competent chat app shouldn&#39;t be so hard. Of course, I imagine most of the Switch 2&#39;s audience won&#39;t care if some of GameChat&#39;s features are half-baked. For the rest of us, the company plans to offer the feature for free until the end of March 2026. One would hope that&#39;s enough time for the company to catch up on two decades worth of progress in online gaming.

Both speakers would frequently show up on sale, but Sonos has confirmed that this is a permanent pricing change for the products. These items have been available for a few years, so the price drop might signal that a refresh is in store for both.

    "title": "Is the $450 Nintendo Switch 2 too expensive?",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/is-the-450-nintendo-switch-2-too-expensive-195750206.html?src=rss",
    "description": "It seems fitting that Nintendo didn’t reveal the Switch 2’s $450 price during its Direct stream this morning — it would have just bummed everyone out. After spending an hour hearing about how the Switch 2 practically fixes almost every problem we had with the original console, and seeing teasers for exciting games like Mario Kart World , why spoil the good vibes with the harsh reality of market economics? Instead, Nintendo revealed the console’s price in the lowliest of media communications: A simple press release. My first reaction was shock. $450 for a mostly portable console? That’s the same retail price as the PlayStation 5, a system that’s also currently on sale for $400 together with Astro-Bot . Sure, the Switch 2 is vastly superior to the original Switch, but it likely doesn’t have PS5-level hardware. The price jump is also surprising since the original Switch launched at $300 in 2017. Can you imagine we thought the $350 Switch OLED was too high-priced? Unfortunately, it’s not 2017. NVIDIA now has mid-range GPUs selling for upwards of $600, the cost of almost every product has gone up, and massive companies like Nintendo are bracing for the potential impact of the Trump administration’s long-threatened tariffs . A $450 Switch 2 is expensive, I’m not denying that. But in the current economic landscape, I would hesitate to call it too expensive. Nintendo Consider this: The Switch 2 is just $50 more than the cheapest Steam Deck, a portable PC gaming handheld with significantly slower hardware, a smaller and lower quality (7-inch, 1280 by 800, 60Hz) screen, and a much bulkier frame. The Switch 2, meanwhile, is just as thin as the original model, it has a 7.9-inch 1080p screen that can run up to 120fps with HDR, and it’s powerful enough to play games at up to 4K/60fps while docked. Based on the games we’ve seen so far, the Switch 2 seems surprisingly powerful for its size. The Switch 2 also improves on its controls with the Joy-Con 2, which now magnetically attach to the consoles, feature larger analog sticks and can also work as mice across a variety of services. You won’t be removing the Steam Deck’s controls without the use of a small saw. And I’ve yet to see a handheld PC maker deliver removable controls that are as comfortable and easy to use as the original Switch ( that means you, Lenovo ). Nintendo’s original Joy-Con were far from perfect, but they did the job, and I’d wager the company has learned enough to make the Joy-Con 2f even better. Nintendo And while you can technically dock other PC gaming handhelds, they won’t see the performance upgrade Nintendo is claiming with the Switch 2. The company says its new console can reach up to 4K/60fps for some titles, thanks to an additional fan in the dock. We don’t know exactly what’s powering the Switch 2 yet, so Nintendo could be drastically overselling its capabilities. But given how seamless docking worked on the first Switch (where it also delivered a bit of a performance upgrade, sans an additional fan), it’s also something I think Nintendo has optimized more than PC companies, who are only just now dipping their toes into portable gaming. Maybe I’m just trying to justify my own purchases (I just realized I’ll probably need a second Switch 2 for my kid), but I just can’t get too angry about a $450 Switch 2. If we see many more $80 games like Mario Kart World , though, we should absolutely riot in the streets.

    "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 had its big debut on Wednesday, and the new console looks to be a sizable, if mostly straightforward, upgrade over its mega-popular predecessor. Tucked between the (pricey) new Donkey Kong and Mario Kart games , mouse mode and overhauled party chat , though, was another significant update: The device supports faster microSD Express cards. This may not be the sexiest feature, but it should bring quicker load times and generally improved storage performance to the upcoming handheld. The company briefly showed new 256GB cards from Samsung and SanDisk during its presentation, complete with Mario logos printed on. However, the news came with a major caveat: The console is only compatible with microSD Express. The cards most people use today — which are based on the older UHS-I bus interface — will only work for loading videos and screenshots from an original Switch, not playing games, according to Nintendo’s support site . Nintendo says this restriction is necessary to preserve the Switch 2’s performance upgrades, and it’s worth noting that the console itself comes with a much more generous 256GB of space by default. But if you ever need to expand the device’s storage, this change will likely make doing so cost extra, while drastically shrinking the options you have to choose from. Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins on the back. Jeff Dunn for Engadget What are microSD Express cards? SD Express is a relatively recent but seldom-used standard that lets SD cards take advantage of the NVMe protocol and PCIe interface, which is the underlying tech used by SSDs. A microSD Express card has a second row of “pins” on its back and can utilize a single lane’s worth of PCIe bandwidth. As a result, it can produce dramatically faster read and write speeds than its UHS-I counterparts. Whereas the latter advertise sequential transfer rates up to 104 megabytes per second (MB/s), microSD Express cards have a theoretical maximum of 985 MB/s. That’s far behind the NVMe SSDs used by the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but in theory, it makes Express cards faster than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes to loading game levels, retrieving saves or copying games to the external storage. It’s worth noting that many UHS-I microSD cards can exceed the 104 MB/s limit with proprietary card readers, but they still fall well short of microSD Express levels even with those. The same goes for speedier UHS-II cards, which are mostly used by professional types with select cameras and PCs and max out at 312 MB/s. (There’s also a UHS-III interface, but nobody uses it. Getting all of this?) Prior to Wednesday, the only reliably available microSD Express card we could find was this model from SanDisk . We recently tested it for our microSD card buying guide , and the upgrade was pretty dramatic. In the synthetic benchmark CrystalDiskMark , the SanDisk card achieved sequential reads up to 899.12 MB/s and sequential writes up to 650.41 MB/s. For comparison, the absolute fastest UHS-I card we’ve tested ( Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus ) topped out at 209.25 MB/s for reads and 193.93 MB/s for writes — so, three to four times slower. In one of our “real-world” tests, the SanDisk Express card took an average of 20 seconds to move a 12GB folder containing various file types and subfolders to a PC and 52 seconds to write the folder back to the card. The Lexar card averaged 67 and 76 seconds, respectively. The gulf in random speeds — which measure how quickly a card can read and write small bits of data scattered throughout a device and tend to be particularly important for gaming — was similarly large, and in some benchmarks even greater. SanDisk's microSD Express card is one of the (very) few options you can actually buy today. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Nintendo has not provided any official transfer speed ratings for the new console just yet, but all of this suggests that the Switch 2’s storage should be much faster than before, even if it’s not on par with the speeds of a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It’s also possible that, like those other consoles, the Switch 2 has hardware dedicated to decompressing files, which could make the real-world improvements over the original Switch’s storage performance even greater. (We’ve reached out to Nintendo and will update this post if we receive any further details.) The original SD Express standard was released in 2018, but the tech has mostly gone nowhere in the years since. There’s been the SanDisk card noted above, a full-size SD card from ADATA and not much else. Previously, Samsung and Lexar announced microSD Express cards that wound up missing their original release windows — though Samsung’s card may just be the same one unveiled today, and Lexar did release a new “Play Pro” microSD Express card on Wednesday. Host devices that support the standard, which are required to even see any improved speeds, have been highly uncommon over the same time frame. (If you put a microSD Express card in a device that doesn’t support the underlying tech, such as the original Switch, it’ll be limited to standard UHS-I speeds.) And while compatible card readers can deliver the faster transfer rates on certain PCs, they aren’t cheap, so at that point most people have been better off buying a faster external SSD . The SD Association pointed us to a LinkedIn page (!) with other compatible devices when reached for comment, but the pickings are still slim, and very few of those support microSD Express cards specifically. The Switch 2 is by far the highest-profile device to embrace the standard, so it could be the thing that finally takes these cards from “cool idea” to “useful niche.” The Samsung and SanDisk microSD Express cards Nintendo quickly teased during its Switch 2 unveiling on Wednesday. Nintendo Questions of price and heat That said, there are multiple reasons why SD Express has failed to take off before this week, and it remains to be seen whether the Switch 2 will truly fix them. First and foremost is price: At launch, these things are likely to be much more expensive than the conventional cards you may have bought for the previous Switch. GameStop and Target , for instance, now list Samsung's 256GB Switch 2 card at $60. SanDisk hasn't confirmed pricing for its licensed card, but the 256GB Express model we tested costs the same, while the 128GB version costs $45. The 256GB Lexar Play Pro is $10 cheaper, but its 512GB and 1TB versions cost a whopping $100 and $200, respectively. GameStop has begun selling its own microSD Express cards for a bit less — $50 for 256GB, $85 for 512GB and $150 for 1TB — but those are still are relatively pricey. For reference, Samsung’s Pro Plus — another UHS-I card we recommend in our buying guide — costs $17 for 128GB, $23 for 256GB, $38 for 512GB and $80 for 1TB as of this writing. That’s a huge difference.&nbsp; What’s more, the Lexar and GameStop cards are the only options we’ve seen that even support capacities greater than 256GB. Nintendo says the console can support up to 2TB of external storage, but no Express card with that capacity appears to exist yet. The Switch 2 will be one of the first mainstream devices to truly push SD Express in earnest, so we’d expect it’ll drive prices down and increase competition over time. But how quickly, and by how much, remains up in the air. Nintendo The other concern relates to thermal management. MicroSD Express cards can pump out significantly faster transfer speeds, but they’re still working with tiny little frames that don’t leave much room to dissipate heat. When we tested SanDisk’s microSD Express model for our guide, we noticed that it slowed down under longer, more sustained loads — not enough to fall behind than UHS-I cards, but still below its peak by a few hundred MB/s. (For its part, SanDisk rates the card's sustained write speeds at 210 MB/s for the 256GB model and 100 MB/s for the 128GB version .) The SD Express spec does have mechanisms for keeping heat in check, and manufacturers like SanDisk advertise similar protections. Nintendo presumably has come up with ways to further avoid severe throttling with the Switch 2. We already know that the new dock comes with a cooling fan built in, for instance. But it’ll be something to keep an eye on once we can move large game files around the device. In a developer Q&amp;A posted to Nintendo’s website on Wednesday, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto notes that the move to microSD Express will help the console’s performance hold up better in the long-term. With the new Mario Kart World , for instance, he says the faster transfer speeds will help make far-off destinations in the game’s open world visible faster. He also notes that Switch 2 games will have larger file sizes, but that he “doubt[s] most people will need a microSD Express card immediately after buying the system” thanks to the Switch 2’s larger built-in capacity. Hopefully that’s the case. It’d be unfair to call this a PlayStation Vita situation, as that portable console relied solely on proprietary memory cards, and the Switch 2 will support options from several third-party manufacturers. The change appears justifiable from a technical perspective, and the growing pains that come with adopting new tech like this should ease up eventually. But as it stands now, storage upgrades for the new console look like they’ll be much pricier and more limited to start. And exactly how much of an advantage the new tech provides is something we won’t know until the console arrives in June . Update (4/4/2025) : We've updated this article with pricing details for new microSD Express cards from Samsung and GameStop.

    "title": "A Minecraft Movie review: It's good, actually",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-its-good-actually-190035499.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Hear me out. I too rolled my eyes when A Minecraft Movie was announced. We&#39;re all tired of seeing Jack Black in video game movies — he was fine in Super Mario Bros. , but good god Borderlands was a disaster . And the Minecraft film&#39;s trailers did it no favors, another soulless movie produced on a virtual set about a game that&#39;s completely open-ended and plotless. But it turns out A Minecraft Movie is actually good. Honestly, I&#39;m as surprised as you are. A Minecraft Movie isn&#39;t exactly groundbreaking, to be clear. It certainly never reaches the heights of The Lego Movie . But it&#39;s surprisingly funny for a children&#39;s movie, and it delivers a decent message about championing creativity in a world that wants to beat down free-thinking non-conformists. And if you were around for the inexplicable Napoleon Dynamite craze of the mid-2000&#39;s, you&#39;ll notice plenty of that film&#39;s quirky sensibility from director Jared Hess. From the beginning, A Minecraft Movie seems well aware of the ridiculousness of its own existence. The story starts off with Jack Black&#39;s Steve (dressed just like the game&#39;s default skin) retelling his obsession with &quot;the mines,&quot; and his inability to go digging while he was a kid. He later grows up, gets a boring office job and remembers his erstwhile calling to make holes in the earth. Once he makes his way into a cave, he stumbles into a portal that brings him to the blocky &quot;Overworld&quot; of the Minecraft universe. It&#39;s classic isekai stuff — the genre of anime where the main character is transported to another (often digital) world. And yes, I know all of this sounds incredibly contrived as I write this, but Black&#39;s zaniness really sells the absurdity of the film. It&#39;s as if he&#39;s saying out loud, &quot;Yes, I know the idea of a Minecraft movie is beyond dumb, but at least you get to spend time with me in classic Jack Black mode!&quot; Now if you&#39;re tired of his schtick, that may be a major knock against the film. But for me, it was a nice reminder of his Tenacious D days. Warner Bros. The film eventually focuses on two siblings, Henry (Sebastian Hansen) and Natalie (Emma Myers), who are moving to a small Midwestern town after the death of their mother. Natalie is gearing up for a social media producer role at a local business, while Henry is forced to adapt to a new school. Coincidentally, a former gaming superstar lives in their town, Jason Momoa&#39;s Garret &quot;The Garbageman&quot; Garrison, who befriends Henry as another outcast. Danielle Brooks&#39; Dawn, a struggling local realtor/mobile zookeeper, ends up taking Natalie under her wing after seeing how much she&#39;s sacrificing for her brother. Inevitably, thanks to a glowing MacGuffin, those four characters also stumble into the same portal that sent Steve to the Overworld. They quickly run into Steve, break their glowing MacGuffin and then head off to find a way to fix it and return home. If any of this sounds boring, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not really important. What works best in A Minecraft Movie is the humor and personality Hess stuffs in between the trappings of a big budget Hollywood game adaptation. Warner Bros. The majority of the film hinges on Jack Black&#39;s persona, but I also enjoyed seeing Jason Mamoa play an egotistical manchild who&#39;s in love with video games. He&#39;s decked out in an absurd wig and hot pink jacket, and Mamoa hams it up just as well as he did Fast X . He&#39;s a jerk at times, but he&#39;s also kind to Henry and clearly doesn&#39;t care what anyone thinks of his personal style. The rest of the cast mostly plays it straight against the force of Black and Mamoa&#39;s personalities, but they each get a few moments to shine. Whenever the core story starts to fall flat, A Minecraft Movie veers into more interesting territory, like a hapless Minecraft villager who stumbles into the real world. For those who don&#39;t play the game, villagers are simple NPC who can&#39;t speak, and often find themselves in danger. I got a kick out of seeing him navigate traffic and have a meet-cute with Jennifer Coolidge&#39;s Vice Principal Marlene, a relationship that gets weirder than you&#39;d think. (Again, it&#39;s like something straight out of Napoleon Dynamite .) Warner Bros. I’m no Minecraft devotee, but I wish the film’s interpretation of the game’s blocky graphics were a bit more pixelated. While the characters and animals we see resemble their game counterparts, their over-designed look clashes with the beautiful simplicity of Minecraft’s aesthetics. I’m sure it’s tough to unite the low-poly look with live action, while also delivering polished CG that audiences expect, but the path A Minecraft Movie took just feels over-cooked. That being said, the film’s game world seems more alive than the empty virtual sets in Quantumania. There are tons of characters milling about, and the environments all feel distinctly Minecraft . The kids in my press screening didn’t seem to mind the shift in visual language. They loved seeing the game’s creatures in any form — a family of pandas got a theater-wide “awww.” And they also loved seeing in-game Minecraft tricks represented on the big screen, like using a water block to cushion a fall. My daughter Sophia’s verdict? “I liked it, but I don’t think I’d want to see it again,” she said. But I know she’s lying. We’ll likely end up seeing this thing hundreds of times at home, and even more so once her brother jumps aboard the Minecraft bandwagon. I won’t mind, though. As far as kid’s movies go, it’s a world I wouldn’t mind revisiting.

    "description": "Following its big Switch 2 presentation , Nintendo revealed in an interview with the team behind the console that one of the (arguably better) names the company was considering before it landed on Switch 2 was \"Super Nintendo Switch.\" \"There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one,\" Kouichi Kawamato, the producer on the Switch 2, says. \"We even considered ideas like 'Super Nintendo Switch.'\" The issue with the name was that even though drawing a parallel to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) was fun, it was also potentially confusing. The SNES was the successor to the NES, but it couldn't play NES games. \"Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES.\" Adding a number to the end of the original console's name (the general strategy Nintendo's competitor Sony has taken with the PlayStation) just made things a lot simpler and easier to understand. Nintendo's caution isn't totally unfounded. The Wii U was more powerful than the Wii and featured a unique controller in the Wii U GamePad. Because it's name was so similar to Nintendo's older console, it was backwards compatible with the Wii and it supported pre-existing accessories like Wii Remotes, though, it was viewed as an add-on rather than a new device worth upgrading to. There were other problems that helped do the Wii U in, like a steep decline in support from third-party game developers and a failure on Nintendo's part to explain what made the console distinct, but the name certainly didn't help. The Switch 2 is much better set up for success than the Wii U, but \"sticking to what works\" seems like the defining idea of the new console, so the name is following suit.

    "description": "The entry-level laptop from modular computing company Framework , which we first saw in February, is almost ready to roll. Founder and CEO Nirav Patel said on Wednesday that you can reserve the Framework Laptop 12 on April 9 at 11AM ET. The Framework Laptop 12 is a colorful 12.2-inch notebook with a 360-degree hinge that lets you fold it back into a (chunky) tablet. This zillionth iteration of that form factor stands out because of Framework's ethos of modular repairability. If you decide it's time for an upgrade in a couple of years, there's no need to fork out $1,500 for a new device; you can simply upgrade its modular parts. The Framework Laptop 12 has a 12.2-inch, 1,920 x 1,200 touchscreen display that, at 400 nits, gets \"much brighter than you typically see from an entry-level or lower-cost laptop.\" It will be available with a 13th-gen i3 or i5 Core processor and up to 48GB of DDR5 RAM. You can also get up to a 2TB 2 TB M.2 2230 SSD, Wi-Fi 6E and the company's standard choice of Windows 11 or Linux. Framework Although it's helpful to have those general spec guidelines, Framework says it won't share the modular machine's full spec breakdown, ship date or pricing until it's available for pre-order. So, you won't know how \"entry-level\" it is until the clock is ticking to reserve one. Although seeing Big Tech marketers weaponizing FOMO to increase sales numbers isn't exactly a rarity these days, it stands out all the more coming from a startup that, in other ways, is among the most consumer-friendly . Patel even cautioned in today's announcement, \"We have a hunch that the early batches are going to go very quickly.\" In other words, you'd better not take too long scanning that spec sheet and weighing it against pricing before the train pulls out of the station. Regardless, you can learn more about the Framework Laptop 12 in the video below before checking out its full specs on April 9 at 11AM ET. Patel advises pre-order customers to create an account on the company website in advance.

    "description": "Amazon has reportedly joined the growing list of suitors angling to acquire TikTok as a new ban deadline approaches. According to The New York Times , the retailer has made a “last-minute bid” to buy the app, and has approached Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about the offer. It’s not clear why Amazon is making an offer this late in the process. TikTok is currently facing an April 5 deadline to strike a deal, though President Donald Trump has said he would likely extend it if necessary. The Times reports that White House officials don’t seem to be “seriously” considering the longshot bid. Amazon declined to comment. Amazon joins several other companies and investors that have proposed bids. The group includes YouTuber MrBeast (with backing from a group that includes Roblox CEO David Baszucki), Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian (who joined a group of investors known as “Project Liberty”) and Perplexity AI, which has proposed integrating the shortform video into its search engine. Even with the deadline just days away, we still don't know exactly when a decision will be made about TikTok’s future. Trump has said he wants to announce a deal before the Saturday deadline.

    "description": "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) says it’s delaying shipments to the US this month while it works out how it will deal with the wide-ranging tariffs President Donald Trump announced this week, according to The Guardian . “As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions, including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans,&#8221; JLR told The Guardian . The automaker is responding to a 25 percent Trump-ordered tariff on imported vehicles that went into effect Thursday and could add $5,000 to $10,000 or more to the price of a new car in the US. JLR said this week that its business remains “resilient,” but those living in the town where its cars are made weren’t optimistic, with one telling The Guardian that the tariffs could lead to job losses. About a quarter of the 400,000 vehicles JLR sells every year go to US buyers, as The Sunday Times notes in its own story about the pause this morning. It’s thought that the automaker has enough existing US stock to last about two months, and it would take about 21 days for more to come once shipments resume, the Times writes. JLR isn’t alone in its concerns. Earlier this week, Nintendo blamed Trump’s new tariffs as it delayed US preorders of the Switch 2 , originally scheduled to start on April 9th. In the wake of the tariffs announcement, the US Stock market lost $6.6 trillion in two days — a record, according to The Wall Street Journal — and industries are bracing for negative impacts to the cost and availability of just about everything , including the high-powered GPUs used by AI companies, gadgets of all types , and even board games",

    "description": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good of a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.&nbsp; You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts. Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on. Featured in this article How we test wireless earbuds Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, with earbud makers often reserving certain software tricks for their own preferred ecosystem, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms. Comfort No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip I can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one of your ears needs something bigger or smaller than the other. Good sound Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, I care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music I’m listening to. I want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. I look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in my favorite songs. Active noise cancellation What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings. Long battery life Most earbuds these days can reach between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with. Water resistance Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At minimum, you should be looking for earbuds that offer IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life. The best overall wireless earbuds Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L) Just like their predecessors, Sony’s newer WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the 1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on. Some people found the WF-1000XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box. On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 — with substantially better noise cancellation to boot. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth, so you can pair with two devices at the same time. It’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm. Read my&nbsp;full WF-1000XM5 review . The best budget earbuds under $100 Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.&nbsp; And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app. Read my full Nothing Ear (a) impressions . The best noise-canceling earbuds Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job at offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life and putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts. The QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II in terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio. Read my&nbsp;full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review . The best earbuds for sports and working out Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL) After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller. The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users. The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout. If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.&nbsp; Read our full&nbsp;Powerbeats Pro 2 review . The best earbuds for iPhone owners Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) For those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option. The AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you. Where the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem. In the fall of 2024,&nbsp; Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health features &nbsp;for the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss. Read my full AirPods Pro (second-gen) review . The best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint. The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens. But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but I’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it. Read my full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review . The best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise. Google’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors. Got a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package. Read my full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review . The best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) Beats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort. What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using. The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Fit Pro; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price. Read my full Beats Studio Buds Plus review . The best earbuds for sound quality Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L) Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest. These earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread. Read my&nbsp;full Momentum True Wireless 4 review . The best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone Noise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity. On the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with. Overall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes&#8230; there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port. The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking. Read my full AirPods 4 review . The best earbuds for voice calls on Android Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L) Sony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear. The Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for me during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear me without issue, even when I’m answering a quick call on the street.

    "description": "Earlier this week, when it seemed as though TikTok&acirc;&#128;&#153;s fate in the US would actually be decided by April 5th, everyone &acirc;&#128;&#148; from Amazon to the founder of OnlyFans &acirc;&#128;&#148; was coming out of the woodwork to buy it. As it turns out, none of them had a chance. And now, thanks to President Donald Trump&acirc;&#128;&#153;s tariff war, no one may get to buy TikTok.&nbsp; People familiar with the matter tell me that, despite all of the bids for the app, the White House was only seriously considering an Oracle-led consortium, which included many of ByteDance&acirc;&#128;&#153;s biggest investors who were set to roll their stakes into a new, US entity.&nbsp; The proposal, which would have licensed the app&acirc;&#128;&#153;s algorithm from China and shuffled some shareholder money around to make TikTok look more independent from ByteDance, was set to be announced before President Trump went nuclear on tariffs . As others have reported and I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve independently confirmed, his tariff announcement on Wednesday torched any immediate chance of the TikTok proposal being blessed by the Chinese government.&nbsp; On Friday, less than an hour after Trump said he was pushing back the clock on banning TikTok by another 75 days to finish working out a deal, ByteDance &amp;hellip; Read the full story at The Verge.",

Each is listed under the office “OCH,” which in other agency documents refers to the Office of the Chairman . Makecha is a finance executive who, according to LinkedIn, has most recently worked in a drone detection software company and previously worked at Tesla. Makecha has reportedly been involved through DOGE at OPM and the State Department. Wick is a former Waymo engineer who’s reportedly been given access to systems at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

DOGE has recently expanded into other enforcement agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission , as The Verge reported earlier on Friday. The FCC&#8217;s authority over radio, TV, broadband, and satellite intersects with Musk’s businesses, like granting certain permissions for SpaceX’s Starlink operations . Its role as a regulator and enforcer also means it stores information on SpaceX and its competitors in order to make decisions. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has previously said that Musk would recuse himself from potential conflicts. The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what the DOGE staffers’ role will be at the agency or what restrictions there will be on their data access.",

He’s now a vice president at the company, and he will be heading up the Ring, Blink, Amazon Key, and Sidewalk teams. Siminoff is replacing Liz Hamren, who had taken over following Siminoff’s initial departure. Hamren and the team “have done an awesome job driving the business, delivering strong results, and bringing a lot of delightful experiences to neighbors,” Siminoff says in an Amazon Q&amp;A . He adds that the “AI transformation happening right now” is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity.” In the Q&amp;A, Siminoff also says that he and Panos Panay, Amazon’s SVP of devices and services, have talked “a lot” about “experiences we can create with devices that are awesome on their own, but even better together. I think you’ll continue to see a lot of that from us moving forward – helping customers stay safe, connected, and informed as part of a magical connected experience.” The day after Siminoff originally left Amazon, Siminoff sold a new company, Honest Day&#8217;s Work, to Latch , which he helped rebrand to Door.com .

The something, announced earlier this week, is a set of globally applied tariffs that make no sense on their face. No sane economist would endorse this.

    "title": "Trump’s TikTok delay is ‘against the law’ top Senate Intelligence Democrat says",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/643964/tiktok-trump-ban-delay-warner-congress-response",
    "description": "President Donald Trump’s additional 75 day delay to TikTok’s sale-or-ban deadline leaves service providers like Apple, Google, and Oracle on shaky ground, and, according to one influential Democrat, is straight-up “against the law.” After Trump announced the extension on Friday, 12 Republican members of the House Select Committee on China, including Chair John Moolenaar (R-MI), released a joint statement in response. The statement did not address legal concerns with the second extension, but it said that “any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans.&#8221; The letter says signatories &#8220;look forward to more details&#8221; on a proposed deal. In a separate statement, three Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, including Chair Brett Guthrie (R-KY) struck a similar note, saying that, “any deal must finally end China’s ability to surveil and potentially manipulate the American people through this app.” “The whole thing is a sham if the algorithm doesn’t move from out of Beijing&#8217;s hands” Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-VA) was more critical in a phone interview with The Verge . “The whole thing is a sham if the algorithm doesn’t move from out of Beijing&#8217;s hands,” Warner said. “And close to 80 percent of Republicans knew this was a national security threat — will they find their voice now?&#8221; Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office delaying enforcement of the TikTok divestiture law, a move legal experts already found questionable . Then, he failed to announce a deal before the new April 5th deadline amid chaos over new global tariffs. Letting the delay expire would have put US companies that serviced TikTok after the deadline at even greater risk of hefty penalties. The original Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support to address what lawmakers insisted was a pressing national security threat, then upheld by the Supreme Court in January. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese government could access US user data or put its thumb on the scales of the recommendation feed through ByteDance, but many lawmakers have consistently doubted that defense.&nbsp; As the Trump administration has opted to effectively ignore the law, however, Congress has been relatively quiet. “Trump&#8217;s unilateral extension is illegal and forces tech companies to once again decide between risking ruinous legal liability or taking TikTok offline” A few Senate Democrats, including Ed Markey (D-MA), recently warned Trump that another extension would only introduce more legal uncertainty, and some expressed doubt that some of the reported deal scenarios could even resolve the app’s legal concerns. In a statement after Trump’s second extension, Markey says while he’d like to see the deadline pushed, “Trump&#8217;s unilateral extension is illegal and forces tech companies to once again decide between risking ruinous legal liability or taking TikTok offline.” He called the move “unfair to those companies and unfair to TikTok’s users and creators.” Instead, Trump should go through Congress to pass Markey’s bill to the extend the deadline, he says.&nbsp; Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a member of the China Committee who’s criticized the law and warned it will harm free expression and creators’ livelihoods, also wants to see a solution go through Congress, but is seeking a full repeal of the law. Still, he called Trump’s delay a “good step.” The new statements from China Committee and E&amp;C Republicans appear to be the first coordinated moves to put a firm line in the sand on the topic. Some Republicans who support the divest-or-ban law have previously urged Trump’s compliance in one-off statements or writings. Moolenaar previously warned in an op-ed that an adequate deal must fully break ties with ByteDance after reports that Trump was considering a deal with Oracle that would potentially leave some ties intact. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told reporters earlier this week that if a deal doesn’t comply with the statute, he “would advise the President against it.” If he can’t get a deal to sell the company in a way that fully complies, Hawley thinks Trump “ought to enforce the statute and ban TikTok. This middle way, I don&#8217;t think is viable.” Warner maintains that lawmakers want a TikTok sale that keeps the app in the US, and he says the Biden administration should have been more aggressive in getting negotiations started. He remains concerned that TikTok’s ownership structure could allow a foreign adversary government to influence young Americans.&nbsp; &#8220;During the negotiations, we saw the enormous bias in TikTok on things like the Uyghurs, the Hong Kong protests, the conflict in Gaza,” says Warner. “That was how we got 80 percent of the vote.” Warner says he remains concerned about the security of US user data, but sees the potential for TikTok to be used to “shape public opinion” as the more serious threat. Still, lawmakers seem unlikely to do much beyond (maybe) trying to pass a new law should Trump continue to flout the existing one. “Congress,” says Hawley, “we don&#8217;t have an enforcement arm of our own.”",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner",
    "description": "Robot vacuums are impressive devices that will clean your floors well and — thanks to bigger batteries and better robot brains — rarely get tired of doing their job. Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor to full-fledged home robots that can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run. &nbsp; Best robot vacuum Best budget robot vacuum Best mopping robot vacuum for hard floors Best robot vacuum / mop hybrid Best midrange robot vacuum / mop Best robot vacuum for pet hair Other robot vacuums to consider What I’m testing and what’s coming next How I test robot vacuums I’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you. Along with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs. Best robot vacuum Dustbin capacity: 270ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing : Hot water and heated air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 10,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts , Apple Home via Matter Roborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed. The S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the S7 MaxV Ultra and has been steadily improving it. That&#8217;s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest. For $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the Refill &amp; Drainage System model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the SwitchBot S10 with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it. The S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up. Roborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. It also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. Its sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners. Roborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” Roborock also sells the S8 Max Ultra (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV. There are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good. Read my Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra review . Best budget robot vacuum Dustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: No / Mop lift: No / Mop washing : No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: No / Suction power: 5,300Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you&#8217;re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin. Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris. Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean. Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations. 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots. It&#8217;s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin. Best mopping robot vacuum for hard floors Dustbin capacity: 1L / Self-empty dock option: No / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing : Yes, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,200Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks. The Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors. Its charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks. Its charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe In fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets. Narwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test. The app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job. Best robot vacuum / mop hybrid Dustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop-lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing : Hot water, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive. The X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you. Its signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius. While it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you Roborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features. The X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer. The X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature. Best midrange robot vacuum / mop Dustbin capacity: Unknown / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing : Yes, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Remote check-in : No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber / bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home The Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the Eufy X8 Pro self-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection. With 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.” The X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them The Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.) An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places. The X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out. While its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn&#8217;t effective. The Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out. Best robot vacuum for pet hair Dustbin capacity: 250 ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, up and over / Mop washing : Yes / Mapping: Yes, vSLAM / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: N/A / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol. While Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. The newest model, the&nbsp; Combo 10 Max , is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line , plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). While its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its retractable mopping system is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. The Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The j9 Combo Plus has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. iRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition. While its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use vSLAM , not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted. I really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. Overall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the Roomba j9 Plus . It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping. Other robot vacuums to consider The 360 Vis Nav ( $1,199.99 ), Dyson’s first robovac in the US in almost a decade, is a powerful beast and the best robot vacuum for carpets I’ve tested. But its navigation needs a lot of work. If you have a simple floor plan with a lot of carpets, it is worth considering, but the short battery life and lack of an auto-empty dock are major cons. Read more in this hands-on . The Roomba j7 ($599.99) is a previous top pick that has great AI-powered obstacle detection, excellent navigation skills, and superior cleaning power. It can be a bit rough with furniture, but it is aggressive at getting your floors clean and is a great vacuum-only Roomba. The Dreame X30 Ultra ( $799.99 $1,399.99 ) is the older version of my top pick for a vacuum / mop hybrid and is a great buy if you can get it on sale. It does most everything the X40 Ultra does, just with lower suction power (8,3000Pa) and no flexi-arm. The Roborock Q8 Max Plus ( $259.99 $599.99 ) is the bigger brother to the Q5 Pro (my pick for pet hair in my budget robot vacuum guide ), adding better obstacle detection (still no camera) and better mopping. However, it has a smaller bin to make way for a much bigger water reservoir for mopping (350ml). If you like the idea of the Q5 Pro but want better mopping, this is a good option. The Roborock S8 Plus ( $759.99 $999.99 ) is a great vacuum that can mop well, has good obstacle detection, and has a sleeker, smaller charging / auto-empty dock with no water tank. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do a good job, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors. The&nbsp; Roborock S8 Pro Ultra &nbsp;( $1,399.99 $1,599.99 ) is similar to the S8 MaxV but ditches the camera, so it’s less effective at dodging obstacles than the S8 MaxV. Get this if you don’t want a camera on your robot and don’t mind not having Matter support or a built-in voice assistant. The Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 ( $449.99 $699.99 ) was my previous runner-up pick for a midrange option that self-empties its bin, vacuums, and mops. It mops very well, but you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin. What I’m testing and what’s coming next Roborock’s Saros 10 ($ 1,599.99 ) and 10R ($ 1,599.99 ) are upgrades to the&nbsp; S8 MaxV Ultra . Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed — a new option for Roborock — and feature an AdaptLift chassis to climb high room transitions. The 10R features 19,000Pa suction power,&nbsp;StarSight 2.0 navigation, and oscillating mops. The Saros 10 has 22,000Pa of suction power, lidar navigation, and the vibrating flat mopping pad of the S8 MaxV. Roborock also recently released the&nbsp;$1,899 Saros Z70 , the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. It also boasts 22,000Pa suction power, supports Roborock’s StarSight navigation system , and features an AdaptLift chassis. iRobot recently announced a new Roomba lineup that starts at $299 and goes up to $999, and is currently available to pre-order. All of the robovacs come with lidar navigation and mapping, 7,000Pa suction power, and four suction levels. The pricier 405 and 505 models are the first Roombas to feature dual spinning mopping pads, while the 505 also offers heated mop drying, which is something even&nbsp; the higher-end Combo 10 Max lacks. The company has yet to provide a release date for the robot vacuums. The Dreame X50 Ultra ($ 1,699.99 ) adds a “motorized swing arm”&nbsp; that acts like a leg , allowing the robovac to climb a transition up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it&#8217;s a lot like the X40 Ultra, only with higher suction power. The Ecovacs Deebot X8 Pro Omni ($ 1,299.99 ) is the first Deebot with a roller mop. The mop is also extendable and self-cleaning and pairs with 18,000Pa of suction power and a redesigned auto-empty fill dock. The&nbsp; Switchbot K10 Plus Pro Combo &nbsp;($799.99) is an upgrade to the c ompact K10 Plus, a previous pick for the best robot vacuum for small spaces. It has better obstacle detection and a bump up to 3,000Pa of suction power. Plus, its auto-empty dock incorporates a manual stick vacuum. The Switchbot S20 Pro robot vacuum / mop hybrid, the successor to my previous pick for favorite mopping vacuum, the S10 , is scheduled to launch in May or June. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush and 15,000Pa of suction power, more than twice that of the prior model. SharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum / mop ($ 999.99 ) can lift itself over rugs by up to 20mm. Uniquely, its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags. Roborock’s Qrevo Curv ( $1,599.99 ) can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The svelte-looking bot gets its name from a curved FlexiArm Arc side brush, which helps prevent hair from tangling as much. Narwal’s&nbsp; Freo Z Ultra &nbsp;( $1,499.99 ), coming this spring, is an upgrade to my current pick for a best mopping bot . It features dual cameras and dual AI chips for seeing and identifying objects, which should help with obstacle detection and vacuuming methods. The Eufy S1 Pro ($1,499) has a long roller mop that self-cleans as it mops and features a square-ish design that allows it to get into corners more easily. A single rubber roller brush, 8,000Pa of suction, and 3D-powered obstacle detection tackle the vacuuming. The Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn&#8217;t need a cloud connection and uses cameras to navigate and is the first robovac mop I’ve seen that can suck up wet spills as well as dry. Here’s some video of it in action . How I test robot vacuums I test robot vacuums constantly. At any time, there are seven or eight of these busy little bots roaming my floors. Alongside everyday use, I put them through a gauntlet of specific tests. This includes testing object detection and avoidance with phone chargers, socks, a pencil, and fake pet poop. I throw in Cheerios or popcorn to see if they know to vacuum that up rather than avoid it. I also run them over oatmeal and flour to see how well they pick up fine debris and have them tackle both thick and low-pile carpets. I watch to see how they handle rug tassels, skinny chair legs, and room transitions. For mopping prowess, I test them on hardwood and tile floors with dried milk, fresh OJ, and ketchup. I monitor how quickly they fill up their bin / auto-empty dock and how efficiently they use water and clean their mop pads. I also set schedules, hook them up to voice assistants, and play with any advanced features in the app. I evaluate how well they map and how easy the maps are to edit and use, as well as test and unique features such as home security camera capabilities, AI cleaning programs, and auto-mop removal. Superior cleaning power It’s not all about suction. In my testing, the brush is also a big factor in how well a robot will clean your floors. A large rubber roller brush is much better than a small bristle brush at picking up debris. It&#8217;s also less prone to getting tangled up with hair. Two brushes are better than one, and a brush housing that has some flexibility — so it can move with the contours of the floor — is also more effective. Mopping prowess It’s hard to find a robot vac that doesn’t have some form of mopping, but not all mops are created equal. I looked for mopping bots that could get up dried-on stains, like milk and ketchup, and scrub up small wet spills without messing themselves up. Oscillating, spinning, or vibrating mop pads clean better than bots that just drag a wet rag around, but the new self-cleaning roller mops that are beginning to appear are even more effective. Auto-carpet sensing is also important since it prevents the robot from accidentally mopping your rug. A big bin&#8230; A big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. The largest I’ve seen is 800ml, but anything over 500ml is decent. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots, plus the popularity of self-empty dock / charging bases, it’s getting harder to find small robot vacs with big bins. But they’re worth considering — especially if you have carpets and pets. I love self-empty docks, but sometimes you don’t have space for them, and if you like your robot to be out of sight (living under your bed or sofa), you’ll want a big bin and no dock. &#8230; Or a self-empty dock These are becoming standard now and coming down in price (thankfully). A self-empty dock turns the charging base for your robot into a motorized emptying station that sucks out the dirt from its bin. (Warning: this process can be loud!) This saves you from having to pull out the bin after every few runs and empty it yourself. Instead, you’ll have to replace the bag (and buy new ones) when it gets full, generally about once a month. Many robots now have a self-empty dock option you can add later, although buying them together is generally cheaper. AI-powered obstacle detection Another nice-to-have feature, AI-powered obstacle detection helps your robot “intelligently” detect and avoid clutter (and a potential poop apocalypse if it encounters pet waste ). These models use cameras (worth noting) to see objects in their path and onboard processors to “decide” how to approach them based on what they see. All AI is not created equal, however, and some are much better at this than others. The end result is that robot vacuums with AI detection are less likely to get stuck when cleaning, so you’re more likely to come home to a clean floor rather than a beached bot. Reliable mapping A robot that maps your house will get into every nook and cranny better than one that bumps and rolls around. Mapping also lets you send the robot to clean specific rooms rather than the whole space and add virtual walls to prevent your bot from going where you don’t want it to. These are crucial if you have delicate objects or areas in your home that regularly trap robots. Most robots use variations on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology , such as lidar or vSLAM . Easy-to-use app and voice control A good app has easy controls to stop and start your vacuum, scheduling options (including do-not disturb hours), plus good mapping features. Nice-to-have features are room-specific cleaning and settings (so you can tell your vacuum to clean the kitchen or have it mop and vacuum the kitchen but only vacuum the living room). My biggest frustration with apps is maps that are fiddly to update and / or crash and must be rebuilt constantly. Most vacuums now have voice control (see FAQs), but some offer more in-depth control, such as telling Alexa to have the robot clean twice under the dining room table. Good battery life Nearly all robot vacuums can “recharge and resume” — take themselves back to their dock when they’re low and recharge before picking up where they left off. But a vacuum with at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is ideal) will clean the whole house in one go. If it takes too long, noisy robots that are constantly running will get shut off by annoyed family members who aren’t about to clean the room for you. Repairability Robot vacuums are quite an investment, and it’s important to be able to buy replacement parts to keep them going for longer and have access to good support in case your robot has a serious issue. Does suction power matter in robot vacuums? Suction power is measured in pascals (Pa) , and while most vacuums offer between 5,000 and 8,000, we’re starting to see robots with 18,000 and even 22,000Pa. Higher suction power will do a better job getting the fine dust and debris off your floor, but it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s paired with effective brushes. The real key to a clean floor with a robot vac is consistency. Run it daily if you can; it won’t keep up as well if it only runs once a week. If you want hands-free cleaning everywhere, you’ll want to budget for one per floor or be prepared to move it around. You can also buy extra charging bases, and most models can map multiple floors. Do all robot vacuums work with voice control? Yes, every Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuum worth its salt today works with Alexa or Google smart speakers for voice control. However, some are limited to stop, start, pause, and maybe suction level, whereas others can be told to go clean specific areas. Here’s how to set up a bot with Alexa voice control or Google Home voice control . A couple of manufacturers now also work with Siri Shortcuts, so you can use Apple’s Siri voice assistant to command your bot . Robot vacuums are now part of Matter , meaning more opportunities for smart home integration and native Siri voice control for robot vacuums. Which robot vacuums will work with Matter? Matter is a new smart home standard that allows connected gadgets to work with any smart home platform, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. When connected to your smart home platform through Matter, you should be able to control basic robot actions including start / stop and changing cleaning modes, as well as get alerts directly in the app, meaning you won’t need to use the manufacturer’s app for these functions. The latest Matter spec, Matter 1.4 , adds support for cleaning specific areas, so while you will still need the manufacturer app to set up a map, you will be able to use your smart home platform app and / or voice assistant to direct the robot to do things like clean the kitchen or clean downstairs. Samsung SmartThings and Amazon both support robot vacuums in Matter; Apple has added it to iOS 18.4 , which should come this spring, and Google said support is coming soon. While Amazon Alexa and Google Home have supported robot vacuums for years via the cloud, Matter will bring this control locally. It will also bring support to Apple Home for the first time, allowing you to control them with Siri through HomePods and add them to scenes and automation. There are still relatively few robot vacuums that support Matter. As of March 2025, that list includes: Ecovacs X8 Pro Omni Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo SwitchBot S20 SwitchBot S10 SwitchBot K10 Pro Plus SwitchBot K10 Plus Dreame X50 Ultra Dreame X40 Ultra Roborock Saros 10 and 10R Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Roomba Combo 10 Photos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge Update, April 4th: Updated post to reflect the fact that the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra and Roomba Combo 10 Max&nbsp;now support Apple Home via Matter . Also added the Roborock Saros Z70 and new Roomba lineup while adjusting pricing and availability.",

    "description": "根据发表在《New England Journal of Medicine》期刊上的一项研究，布朗大学的研究人员发现，美国富人的寿命低于欧洲富人。研究对比了 2010 年美国和欧洲不同地区 73,000 多名年龄在 50 至 85 岁之间的成年人数据，以确定财富如何影响一个人的死亡几率。结果显示，财富较多的人通常比财富较少的人寿命更长，尤其是在贫富差距更大的美国。数据还显示，在每一种财富水平上，美国人的死亡率都高于欧洲地区。美国最富有的人的平均寿命比欧洲最富有的人短；部分情况下最富有的美国人的存活率与西欧如德国、法国和荷兰最贫穷的人的存活率相当。研究表明，即使是美国最富有的人也无法避开经济不平等或压力等带来的系统性影响。美国人和欧洲人在 65 岁之后贫富差距缩小，原因是美国穷人已经提前去世了。",

    "description": "马普心理语言学研究所的研究人员对 9169 名瑞典双胞胎样本进行了分析，发现个体在音乐享受上的差异有相当一部分是由遗传因素引起的。研究人员使用“音乐奖励敏感性”（Music Reward Sensitivity）来描述个体对音乐所带来的愉悦感和奖励体验的敏感程度。9169 名年龄在 37 岁至 64 岁之间的瑞典双胞胎参与了问卷调查。双胞胎研究是研究遗传和环境因素对特定形状或行为影响的强大工具，这种方法不需要直接进行基因测序，而是通过比较同卵双胞胎（基因几乎完全相同）和异卵双胞胎（基因相似性约为 50%）之间的相似性来推断遗传因素的作用。研究发现，双胞胎在音乐奖励敏感性上的差异中有 54% 可以用基因差别来解释，这表明享受音乐的能力有一大部分来自遗传。除此之外，音乐奖励敏感性的遗传影响部分独立于一般奖励敏感性和音乐感知能力，这表明享受音乐与“听懂”音乐等认知过程可能使用了不同的神经机制。",

    "description": "在正式宣布 Switch 2 将于 6 月发售之后，任天堂被几乎所有玩家称为是对消费者最不友好的游戏公司。游戏的定价长期稳定在 60 美元，一个重要原因是虽然游戏开发费用不断上涨但玩家的人数也在不断增加，因此游戏开发商如果能卖出更多份拷贝，他们仍然能盈利。直到最近几年，才有部分 3A 游戏开发商将游戏定价提高到 70 美元。现在任天堂将定价进一步提高到了 80 甚至 90 美元，令大部分任天堂玩家目瞪口呆。Switch 2 首发游戏《Mario Kart World》的捆绑版（与游戏机一共购买）价格约 50 美元，但如果单独购买，数字版售价 80 美元，实体版 90 欧元（限于欧洲地区）。Switch 一代游戏如《Super Mario Party Jamboree》、《The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom》和《Kirby and the Forgotten Land》的 Switch 2 版本全部售价 80 美元。《Donkey Kong Bananza》算是例外只要 70 美元。从目前的信息看，Switch 2 的第一方游戏定价基本都是 70/80 美元，第三方游戏开发商没有任天堂这么夸张：Switch 2 版的《Street Fighter 6 Year 1-2 Fighters Edition》零售价 60 美元，而 Square Enix 重制版《Bravely Default》售价为 40 美元。任天堂尚未披露拥有&nbsp;Switch 一代游戏的玩家购买同一款游戏的 Switch 2 版本的升级包定价。",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/my-teens-take-turns-cooking-dinner-for-the-whole-family-2025-4",
    "description": "The author&#39;s teens take turns making dinner for the family. Courtesy of the author In my family we take turns preparing dinner, and that includes our teens. The kids are responsible for choosing the recipe and adding the ingredients to our shopping list. Having them involved helps my husband and I, but also sparks conversations with our kids. Like many families, ours finds there often isn&#39;t enough time for everything &mdash; especially time to hang out with each other in between school, work, activities and other responsibilities. In my family, cooking is one way we work around that. Sometimes I cook, sometimes my husband cooks, and sometimes one or both of our kids makes dinner . Not only has it helped everyone learn useful life skills, it has given us much to talk about &mdash; whether it&#39;s seasonality of produce, the rising costs of some ingredients, or how to read nutrition labels. My husband and I helped in the kitchen as kids I know this isn&#39;t a novel approach; we know many families where kids are engaged in meal planning and prep , and there are plenty of kids&#39; cooking classes, camps, and resources available online. For our family, we&#39;ve enjoyed cooking this way for years and trying myriad types of foods &mdash; and it doesn&#39;t surprise us that studies back up the idea that engaging children in cooking is linked to improvements in their dietary habits. My husband and I relate to this from when we were growing up. We were each responsible for cooking family dinners from time to time starting in grade school due to our parents being busy with work or graduate school. Talking about it now, I think we both gained confidence, a sense of responsibility, and some solid skills. We were proud of what we accomplished &mdash; even when the recipe didn&#39;t quite turn out as expected &mdash; and we felt prepared for when we&#39;d be out of the house and would need to feed ourselves. When we had kids, we wanted to teach them some of those lessons. Among the tools we used were kid-sized utensils, plastic plates and bowls, and &#34;Pretend Soup,&#34; one of chef-author Mollie Katzen&#39;s cookbooks for children. I spoke with her years ago for a short vignette I was writing , and she explained how to make food accessible to young kids. That could mean putting ingredients on a surface at kid level where they can easily see them or engaging them in basic skills like mixing, using extra-large bowls until they get comfortable with it. It helps them feel useful and engaged with the process, she told me, and we found that to be true in our home. They&#39;ve taken over cooking The foundation we provided at home, plus skills gleaned at Scout camping trips, cooking camps or informal &#34;Chopped&#34;-style contests over school breaks, gave my kids enough interest and know-how to want to help &mdash; and then take over &mdash; some of our dinner prep and cooking. Grilled cheese, scrambled eggs, and simple salads were among their early dishes; now that they are teens, they often assign each other a cookbook to pick a recipe from each week. Sometimes it&#39;s a tried-and-true Betty Crocker cookbook, and other times it&#39;s a tome from chef and humanitarian José Andrés. Some recent meals they&#39;ve made include turkey bolognese, spiced catfish sandwiches with Haitian pickled slaw, and gado gado &mdash; a traditional Indonesian salad that I&#39;d never heard of until our son prepared and served it recently. The author&#39;s son prepared a dish new to her. Courtesy of the author The kids are responsible for picking a recipe, adding ingredients we need to our shared grocery list app, choosing the day they&#39;ll cook, and then making it happen &mdash; with at least one adult nearby to answer questions, assist with large-blade appliances, or act as a sous chef when needed. We adapt recipes to our tastes No one in our house tends to follow recipes to the letter when they cook; I don&#39;t eat much meat so we often use a different protein in place of whatever the recipe lists. Our versions generally work &mdash; but my son tested that when he didn&#39;t know where to find white wine and used white wine vinegar instead. It gave the gnocchi soup he was making a little extra zing. And the pad thai that my daughter made one weeknight took well more than an hour even with time-saving modifications, so bedtimes were rapidly approaching as we sat down to dinner. That pad thai recipe is one I&#39;ve never tried to make, and getting to enjoy the resulting noodle dish illustrates one of the great benefits of having multiple chefs in the house. The kids appear undaunted by ingredients or preparation tasks. I skip some recipes because they look time consuming or use a lot of dishes, but my kids are willing to try those. We&#39;ve enjoyed homemade pasta, sushi, soft pretzels, and filled croissants because they were interested in making those things and we knew we&#39;d all be OK however they turned out. (And we always have peanut butter in the pantry in case of a culinary emergency.) Other benefits for my husband and me include having time to finish up work meetings or do other things while dinner is being made, knowing that we&#39;re giving the kids time and space to contribute to the household in a way that they enjoy, and providing a springboard for discussions about bioengineered foods and buying locally. In the gado gado recipe, which came from Katzen&#39;s well-known Moosewood Cookbook, she notes toward the top: &#34;HAVE FUN WITH THIS!&#34; And my kids do.

    "title": "Here's what the smartest people in markets and economics are saying about Trump's tariffs",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-liberation-day-tariffs-reactions-commentators-2025-4",
    "description": "President Donald Trump announced his tariffs on Wednesday. Alex Wong/Getty Images President Donald Trump announced his &#34;Liberation Day&#34; tariffs on Wednesday. Many commentators have questioned the tariffs and highlighted their potential economic consequences. One said Trump was unlikely to U-turn on the tariffs, so it was time to &#34;sell the dip,&#34; not buy it. President Donald Trump announced his &#34;Liberation Day&#34; tariffs on Wednesday &mdash; and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering. Here&#39;s what big names in business and economics have been saying: Business Roundtable Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs &#34;run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters.&#34; He added: &#34;Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.&#34; He said the Business Roundtable &#34;supports President Trump&#39;s goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners&#34; but called on him to introduce &#34;additional reasonable exemptions&#34; and a &#34;transparent, predictable exclusion process.&#34; Larry Summers &#34;Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much,&#34; Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. &#34;The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion.&#34; Summers added that the tariffs were the most expensive and &#34;masochistic&#34; the US had imposed in decades. Larry Summers referred to the tariffs as &#34;masochistic.&#34; Hyungwon Kang/Reuters Mohamed El-Erian &#34;The price action in global financial markets in the immediate aftermath of the US tariff announcement points to major worries about global economic growth,&#34; Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant PIMCO and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on X. Mariana Mazzucato &#34;These tariffs will cause inflation in the United States; they will cause lower consumer power of US workers. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs,&#34; Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV&#39;s &#34;Peston&#34; program. Boaz Weinstein Boaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management&#39;s founder, doesn&#39;t expect Trump to change course, posting on X: &#34;I&#39;m often wrong, but I don&#39;t see him doing a u-turn. This is not a buy-the-dip opportunity. It&#39;s a sell the dip opportunity.&#34; David Rosenberg &#34;So, this tariff file is now being labeled &#39;Make America Wealthy Again&#39;? What is with that adverb &#39;again&#39; which is defined as &#39;returning to a previous condition&#39;? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household … too bad we don&#39;t all live at the average!),&#34; David Rosenberg, the founder and president of Rosenberg Research &amp; Associates, said on X. &#34;Have tariffs really stood in the way of wealth creation in America? I think the title should simply be the truth: &#39;Let&#39;s Make the World Poor Again&#39; (and then we can buy it at a discount),&#34; Rosenberg added. Nouriel Roubini Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the &#34;Liberation Day&#34; label was &#34;Orwellian doublespeak.&#34; &#34;Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be &mdash; ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no &#39;liberation&#39; at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world,&#34; he said on X. Nouriel Roubini described the &#34;Liberation Day&#34; terminology as &#34;Orwellian doublespeak.&#34; AP Images Paul Krugman &#34;I guess it&#39;s just possible that when we get details about the Trump tariffs they will be lower than what he just announced, but based on what he said, he&#39;s gone full-on crazy,&#34; Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter. &#34;If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them,&#34; Krugman added. Howard Silverblatt &#34;March continued with President Trump&#39;s rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth,&#34; wrote Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&amp;P Global column. &#34;Adding to the concern were Elon Musk&#39;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings),&#34; he added. The Yale Budget Lab &#34;The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 2.3% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household consumer loss of $3,800 in 2024$. Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,700,&#34; wrote the Yale Budget Lab in a new analysis published on April 2, shortly after Trump&#39;s blanket tariff announcement. Jared Bernstein &#34;True, the United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries,&#34; said Jared Bernstein, former chief economist, in his newsletter. &#34;That means, as Trump has correctly argued, we can hurt them more than they can hurt us. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners.&#34; &#34;First, though they&#39;ve been explicitly cavalier about the pain they&#39;re causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices &mdash; as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points &mdash; and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it&#39;s not the way of Trump 2,&#34; he added. Jared Bernstein said Trump didn&#39;t give a &#34;coherent rationale&#34; for the tariffs. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Justin Wolfers &#34;Monstrously destructive, incoherent, ill-informed tariffs based on fabrications, imagined wrongs, discredited theories and ignorance of decades of evidence. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else,&#34; said Justin Wolfers, economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky. Daryl Fairweather &#34;If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn&#39;t be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth,&#34; said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin chief economist, on BlueSky. &#34;Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built,&#34; she added. Bill Gross The latest set of tariffs is &#34;a similar event to going off the gold standard in 1971. It&#39;s an epic event. It&#39;s not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It&#39;s something that we&#39;re going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance,&#34; Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC. &#34;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq&#39;s down 5%,&#34; said Gross, who&#39;s also known as &#34;Bond King.&#34; Gross said it&#39;s not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to &#34;catching a falling knife.&#34; Bill Gross said he doubted Trump would back down. REUTERS/Jim Young Steven Blitz &#34;Tariffs attack US trading partners but, in effect, attack US corporate profit margins first,&#34; wrote Steven Blitz, the chief US economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard. &#34;The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. The macro risk hitting markets is real, but only accentuates the devaluation process.&#34; &#34;Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising,&#34; Blitz wrote. Jim O&#39;Neill Jim O&#39;Neill, former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the &#34;sensible&#34; thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services. He said this would be &#34;very healthy for all those countries because it&#39;s the one area of global trade that most countries haven&#39;t done enough in.&#34; If the US wants to continue down this &#34;kamikaze path,&#34; the UK will have to respond, O&#39;Neill added. &#34;It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves.&#34; Stephanie Kelton &#34;Just had a journalist ask me to explain &#34;Liberation Day,&#34;&#34; Stephanie Kelton, author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. &#34;I told him it&#39;s about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets.&#34; George Saravelos George Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said in a Friday note that markets were pricing in a global recession. &#34;This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. The countries that respond the quickest and most forcefully to this shock are those whose currencies will likely be the most resilient. And, on the flipside, the more the US fiscal strategy under the Trump administration lacks visibility, the more the market will punish the dollar and US assets. &#34;One last point: don&#39;t expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. Remember that during the European supply-shock of 2022, the ECB turned hawkish. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed.&#34; Kristalina Georgieva Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that US tariffs posed a &#34;significant risk&#34; to the global economy. &#34;We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,&#34; she said in a statement on Thursday. Kristalina Georgieva is the International Monetary Fund&#39;s managing director. Thibaut Bouvier/World Economic Forum Christine Lagarde Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, told Ireland&#39;s Newstalk that the tariffs would be &#34;negative the world over.&#34; She said Trump&#39;s move &#34;will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate.&#34; Lloyd Blankfein Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, posted on X on Friday: &#34;The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov&#39;ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Why not give them a chance? Make the 10pct min tariff immediate but defer the &#34;reciprocal&#34; part 6 mos. Take the win! The Prez said he&#39;d make us tired of winning…I&#39;m there now!&#34; Jerome Powell Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump&#39;s tariffs actions surpassed all expectations. &#34;While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,&#34; Powell said at a conference for business journalists. &#34;The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.&#34; The central bank president repeatedly said it was too early to tell what the Fed&#39;s response might be. &#34;We&#39;ve taken a step back and we&#39;re watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we&#39;ll be able to act, he said.&#34; American Enterprise Institute Kevin Corinth, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump&#39;s tariffs , which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes &#34;no economic sense.&#34; &#34;The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc,&#34; Corinth wrote. &#34;But even if one were to take the Trump Administration&#39;s tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold.&#34; Mark Zandi In a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody&#39;s Analytics, warned that a recession could &#34;hit imminently and extend until next year&#34; should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate. &#34;Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario,&#34; he predicted. Ed Yardeni Speaking to Bloomberg TV, veteran analyst Ed Yardeni said he hoped the &#34;message that the stock market is sending to the administration is being heard.&#34; &#34;The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy,&#34; he added.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/best-things-for-2-trader-joes-from-worker-and-wife-2025-4",
    "description": "We buy a lot of our favorite groceries at Trader Joe&#39;s now that my husband works there. Jennifer Krosche Moreno We started buying a lot of our groceries at Trader Joe&#39;s once my husband began working there. The chain&#39;s frozen mac and cheese and fried rice are perfect for our busy lifestyle. We find Trader Joe&#39;s meats, produce, and wines are high quality but not too pricey. Ever since my husband started working at Trader Joe&#39;s , our grocery hauls have completely changed. The chain has so many convenient, high-quality, and affordable options that we find ourselves stocking up on the same must-haves week after week. From frozen favorites to pantry staples, here are the Trader Joe&#39;s products we can&#39;t live without right now. We use Trader Joe&#39;s Dutch griddle cakes to make fast-food-style breakfast sandwiches at home. Trader Joe&#39;s Dutch griddle cakes can be heated in the microwave. Jennifer Krosche Moreno These fluffy griddle cakes are the secret to our homemade version of popular fast-food breakfast sandwiches . Add an egg and some Trader Joe&#39;s chicken breakfast sausage, and you&#39;ve got a protein-packed breakfast in minutes. The cakes are also good on their own and easy to heat up in a toaster or microwave. Frozen mac and cheese is a staple at our house. Trader Joe&#39;s has a few types of frozen mac and cheese. Jennifer Krosche Moreno Forget the boxed stuff you have to cook on the stove &mdash; Joe&#39;s Diner frozen mac and cheese is creamy, rich, and indulgent. It heats up in minutes, making it a perfect lunch for busy days or side dish with dinner. This is one of my favorite things to buy at Trader Joe&#39;s . We love getting high-quality meat for a solid price. Trader Joe&#39;s has a range of meats for sale. Jennifer Krosche Moreno The centerpiece of most meals my husband cooks is some sort of meat, so we buy it regularly. Fortunately, Trader Joe&#39;s offers an impressive selection of it at competitive prices. I&#39;ve been impressed by the quality of the meat we&#39;ve gotten at the chain, so we grab beef, poultry, or pork on each shopping trip. Plantain chips are our ultimate anytime snack. Plantain chips are sweet and salty. Jennifer Krosche Moreno Trader Joe&#39;s plantain chips deliver when the craving hits for something salty, sweet, and crunchy. Made with just three ingredients &mdash; plantains, sunflower oil, and salt&mdash; these chips are my guilt-free, go-to snack. We always keep a few bags on hand for road trips, late-night cravings, and afternoon desk snacks. If you prefer a little kick, try Trader Joe&#39;s jerk-style plantain chips. Ice-cream sandwiches are some of our favorite perfectly portioned treats. We love buying Trader Joe&#39;s brownie-coffee crisp ice-cream sandwiches. Jennifer Krosche Moreno We always have ice cream in our freezer, and Trader Joe&#39;s ice-cream sandwiches are some of our favorite buys. They&#39;re the perfect portion-controlled treat for when we&#39;re watching TV after dinner. Some of our top picks are the Mini Mint Mouthfuls, brownie-coffee crisp ice-cream sandwiches, and classic Sublime cookie ice-cream sandwiches. We no longer order takeout since Trader Joe&#39;s has such good frozen alternatives. Trader Joe&#39;s vegetable fried rice can be found in the freezer section. Jennifer Krosche Moreno We&#39;ve been so impressed by Trader Joe&#39;s frozen foods inspired by other countries that we rarely order takeout these days. Trader Joe&#39;s soup dumplings and fried rice are some of our favorite buys. Both dishes deliver on flavor and cost far less than if we&#39;d ordered them from a restaurant. For us, these heat-and-eat options are a game changer for busy nights when cooking from scratch isn&#39;t an option. A few things from the produce section are always in our cart. We always stop by Trader Joe&#39;s produce section. Jennifer Krosche Moreno Eating clean is important to us, so fresh produce is always in our kitchen. We regularly stock up on bananas, berries, and mini carrots for easy snacking for us and our dogs. Plus, the chain&#39;s seasonal fruits and vegetables can be great for trying new recipes. My husband also swears by Trader Joe&#39;s salad kits for quick, no-fuss lunches. Chocolate milk is a staple in our fridge. Trader Joe&#39;s chocolate milk is made with cocoa. Jennifer Krosche Moreno Open our fridge, and you&#39;ll always find a half-gallon of Trader Joe&#39;s chocolate milk. It&#39;s so creamy and delicious. We like to drink it as a coffee alternative , after-dinner sweet treat, or post-workout pick-me-up. We use Goddess dressing as way more than just a salad topper. Trader Joe&#39;s Goddess dressing pairs well with veggies. Jennifer Krosche Moreno Trader Joe&#39;s Goddess dressing is a staple for us. It&#39;s fantastic on salads or as a veggie dip. We also like using it to upgrade pasta or tuna salad . It&#39;s one of the most versatile condiments we own and a great value, as a little goes a long way in terms of flavor. Breaded chicken tenderloin breasts are the star of some quick meals in our house. Trader Joe&#39;s breaded chicken tenderloin breasts can be found in the frozen section. Jennifer Krosche Moreno Trader Joe&#39;s breaded chicken tenderloins are a lifesaver when I&#39;m trying to make a quick, stress-free meal. I like pairing them with Trader Joe&#39;s mac and cheese and some veggies for a dinner that&#39;s ready in minutes. The tenders are also great for adding protein to salads. Trader Joe&#39;s Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and conditioner have become shower staples. Trader Joe&#39;s Tea Tree Tingle shampoo contains peppermint. Jennifer Krosche Moreno Infused with eucalyptus and other botanicals, Trader Joe&#39;s Tea Tree Tingle products leave our hair feeling soft and clean. I like how they make our hair smell, too. A little bit of these goes a long way, which makes them a great value for us. We regularly grab a bottle from Trader Joe&#39;s excellent wine section. We love Trader Joe&#39;s budget-friendly wine section that&#39;s filled with tasty, high-quality options. Jennifer Krosche Moreno I think Trader Joe&#39;s wine selection is unbeatable in terms of value and quality. Whether we need a bottle for a special occasion, a hostess gift, or something to pair with dinner, there&#39;s always an affordable option that tastes like it cost way more than it actually did. There are a lot of bottles available for under $20, and many cost less than $10. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "We planned to spend our retirement traveling. Now, it feels way too financially risky.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/planned-to-spend-retirement-traveling-cant-afford-it-2025-4",
    "description": "Although we planned to spend our retirement traveling, that dream now feels out of reach. lucigerma/Getty Images My husband and I retired early at 55 with modest plans to travel around the US and Canada. Our lower retirement income has not gone far, and bad luck in the past year cut into our savings. Given how quickly our savings have dwindled in just a year, we have nixed our plans to travel. I&#39;d always dreamed of traveling during retirement , and my husband and I had made modest plans to do so. As Canadians, we planned to mostly go on road trips here and in the neighboring United States, maybe occasionally flying to places like Nashville and Las Vegas . My husband retired in 2015 at 55, and I joined him in 2023 when I turned 55. That first summer after I retired, we had an amazing time going to outdoor concerts, car shows, and impromptu day trips. In the coming year, I expected us to do more of the same. However, in the past few months, we realized our retirement dreams may be out of reach. Our income and savings aren&#39;t going as far as we expected My husband has started receiving payments from his Canada Pension Plan, which we both contributed to while working, but mine haven&#39;t yet kicked in. Like many others, we also sought other ways to make money during retirement . As a former teacher, I take substitute-teaching jobs at local schools and writing gigs. My husband also brings in extra money building hunting shacks. When planning our pre-retirement with financial advisors , we felt confident we could live off our savings, pension, and money from our gigs and still travel &mdash; especially since our home is new and paid off (in part thanks to an inheritance I received). We were going to budget for a road trip every year or two until our full benefits kicked in, but we&#39;ve already spent half of what we&#39;d saved in this past year alone. In that time, we&#39;ve had four appliance breakdowns in four months in our new home. We&#39;ve taken in our son&#39;s family until they rebuild following a devastating house fire, and the basement bathroom renovation to accommodate them also cost us 30% more than we anticipated. This unexpected, expensive string of bad luck in a short period of time quickly made a huge dent in our savings that we hadn&#39;t accounted for. On top of that, living on what amounts to about half of my pre-retirement paycheck has been challenging. Between tariffs and inflation, the costs of many essentials, like food, are still higher than we expected. At this rate, we feel like our savings would be depleted far too quickly if we worked travel into our budget. We&#39;ve chosen to be grateful for what we have instead of relying on travel to find joy Worried about the future, we&#39;ve shifted our dreams and put our travel retirement plans on hold. Although we still have some investments and savings, we don&#39;t feel financially comfortable or secure enough to dip into them to spend money on travel as we&#39;d originally planned. This realization was difficult to handle. At times, it took a toll on our relationship: I really wanted to make travel work, while my husband wanted to make sure we could afford to get through the next few years &mdash; especially in the event we encounter more bad luck or costly health issues as we age. After taking a step back and looking at what is really important, we&#39;ve finally found the blurry line between wants and needs and made peace with it. We&#39;ve focused on becoming content in our home and finding happiness in small, local outings: going out to dinner, heading to the movies, driving around to look at Christmas lights, or even just visiting friends and family. After all, we are luckier than many, and our situation could be much worse. We can afford essentials like food and housing. We are surrounded by friends and family. We are healthy, safe, and happy. Knowing what we know now, I think we both would&#39;ve worked a few more years and maybe diversified our investments to further ensure our financial security. Fortunately, we&#39;re at least mortgage-free. Once my benefits also kick in or if I take on another well-paying gig in the future, we may take a trip or two &mdash; but even if not, I have accepted it. I&#39;ve found solace in feeling gratitude for all that we have rather than envy for the things we don&#39;t. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "I'm a lifelong Disney World fan who brought my toddler for the first time. It wasn't anything like I expected.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/should-you-take-toddler-to-disney-tips-best-rides-restaurants-2025-4",
    "description": "&nbsp; Getty Images; Caralynn Matassa/Business Insider I&#39;ve been to Disney World dozens of times but I went with my daughter for the first time this year. At 2 years old, there was a lot she couldn&#39;t (and didn&#39;t want to) do there. Her experience of the park was so different from mine and made me feel like it was new again. I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say my introduction to Disney World is a core memory. When I first stepped through the gates of Magic Kingdom at age 4, it was love at first sight. Over the next three decades, dozens more trips followed. Going as a little kid was wildly different from going as a zitty teen with my younger brother or a recent college grad dragging my boyfriend along. However, even as the parks changed, and I changed, my attachment to them remained consistent. That emotional tie is precisely what&#39;s enabled Disney parks to hold firm as the most visited theme parks in the world, even as the price of a Disney trip has become out of reach for many families. In January, I had the opportunity to visit the parks for a Magic of Milestones media event and thought it was the perfect opportunity to introduce my toddler to Disney life for the first time. At first, I worried she was too young. Googling &#34;What&#39;s the best age to take a kid to Disney for the first time?&#34; yielded nothing conclusive &mdash; some said under a year, while others insisted never take a kid under 5. Lacking a direct answer, I decided to throw caution to the wind and take my 2-year-old and go for it. Surely she&#39;d have an identical experience to my inaugural visit, I thought. I was wrong. Going to Disney World for the first time as a parent didn&#39;t match my expectations at all &mdash; and I can&#39;t wait to go again. Your toddler&#39;s individual temperament will really determine the Disney World rides they can go on My 2-year-old is a daredevil, but she&#39;s short, so the majority of height-limit rides were out of the question. I was looking forward to taking her on more of the baby-friendly rides, where you just sit in a slow-moving car and cruise along, waving at animatronics. What I didn&#39;t anticipate was her sudden onset fear of even moderate darkness. Luckily, Daddy was able to keep her calm. Caralynn Matassa/Business Insider This kid has never asked for a nightlight in her 27 months of life, but suddenly, waiting in the grotto-inspired line for &#34;Under the Sea: Journey of the Little Mermaid,&#34; the dim undersea lighting and slightly spooky ocean sounds were too much for her. &#34;I scared,&#34; she loudly declared approximately 3 ½ minutes into the wait. We turned around and left. We actually made it onto the &#34;Frozen&#34; ride in Norway at Epcot, but that was also a mixed bag. I had completely forgotten that Marshmallow, the giant snowman, makes an appearance near the end, and we were wholly unprepared for the freakout. We avoided dark rides after that. She did love the Prince Charming Regal Carrousel, which we figured would be the case since she makes a point to ride every carrousel she sees. The Mad Tea Party teacup ride was also a big hit &mdash; we were all happy to just sit in it without spinning. On the flip side, toddlers will find Disney magic in the most unlikely of places My daughter&#39;s favorite &#34;ride&#34; was the Skyliner that took us from our hotel to Hollywood Studios. The Skyliner might have been the most magical part of the trip for my toddler. Caralynn Matassa/Business Insider She couldn&#39;t get enough of it. Every time we rode that thing, she hopped up on the bench to stare out the window, singing loudly (much to the amusement of other families who were shuttled in with us), and screaming the names of all the characters she saw on the gondolas swinging by. Beyond the rides, I had measured my expectations for other Disney experiences, like character meet and greets. I&#39;d anticipated that we would need to steer clear of most characters. We&#39;d limited screen time until she turned 2, so she wasn&#39;t super familiar with any of them, and I worried she&#39;d be freaked out seeing them (some for the first time ever) in life-size form. We&#39;d also had an encounter with an Easter bunny the previous year that gave me pause. Surprisingly, she was only a little apprehensive and warmed up to them very quickly. By the end of the Disney Jr. Play and Dance, she was having a dance party with Minnie Mouse and giving her hugs. She couldn&#39;t quite work up the nerve to get that close to Goofy, who is much larger than Minnie, but all these months later, she&#39;s still talking about giving Goofy a high-five &#34;next time.&#34; Meeting Goofy and Max at a safe distance was key. Caralynn Matassa/Business Insider The princesses were an even bigger hit, and it was such a joy seeing her interact with them. Princess Elena was her favorite, despite never having watched the show. The live music shows were also a great choice. On my pre-parenthood trips, I&#39;d never bothered to go to them &mdash; who cares about abbreviated versions of Disney movies I&#39;ve seen a trillion times? For my toddler, though, they were a major win. At under 30 minutes, they&#39;re the perfect length for short attention spans and a great primer for some of the movies she hadn&#39;t seen yet. &#34;For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration&#34; was her favorite and has sparked an intense Queen Elsa phase. The safari ride at Animal Kingdom was also something I&#39;d never done, but we prioritized it knowing my toddler&#39;s love of zoos. It was a major hit. The fireworks shows were always a highlight of my Disney World trips, but they were too much for my toddler The &#34;Fantasmic!&#34; show at Hollywood Studios is my single favorite Disney experience, and I&#39;ve always made a point to go multiple times during each of my past trips. However, we didn&#39;t even consider going with my daughter. She had never experienced a fireworks show before, so to test the waters, we took her to &#34;Luminous: The Symphony of Us,&#34; a 17-minute show in Epcot. We watched from the World Showcase because I figured that was far enough away from the sights and sounds not to be too overwhelming. I was extremely wrong. The Epcot fireworks show was a big no. Caralynn Matassa/Business Insider My toddler was immediately freaked out by the first boom. Unfortunately, because the show was at 9 p.m. (technically after the park closed), all the stores and restaurants were inaccessible for an escape. My husband ended up taking refuge near a trash can, singing songs to keep her distracted until the show ended. Part of this was a rookie mistake: We forgot to bring noise-canceling headphones for her. That said, I doubt she would have kept them on even if we had. After that mishap, we knew to avoid &#34;Fantasmic!&#34; and other fireworks shows, such as &#34;Happily Ever After at Magic Kingdom.&#34; My toddler ate way more at Disney World than I expected At home, my daughter is a very picky eater , convinced she can exist on air and the occasional Cheerio alone. It&#39;s a major stressor for both my husband and me in our day-to-day lives, but I made the decision to forcibly chill out and not worry about it while on vacation. However, instead of the skipped meals and crankiness we were anticipating, we were pleasantly surprised by her slightly more adventurous appetite at Disney World. Now, she wasn’t exactly angling to chow down on a turkey leg, but it was better than I expected. We all loved the pastry selection at Cinderella&#39;s Royal Table. Caralynn Matassa/Business Insider Her favorites included the Mickey-shaped blueberry muffins at Cinderella&#39;s Royal Table , the pizza at Connections Cafe, and clementines and french fries wherever we could find them. The biggest win, though, was the Nemo Fin-tastic Cake at Coral Reef, one of my favorite restaurants in Disney World. She&#39;s usually not a sweets girl (much to my distress, as a big Dole Whip fan) and the cake was so cute she wasn&#39;t initially sure whether it was even edible. Once she took the first bite, though, she couldn&#39;t get enough. Another bonus is that kids under 3 eat free at all-you-care-to-enjoy Disney restaurants. Roundup Rodeo , a new barbecue restaurant in Toy Story Land at Hollywood Studios, was a great option for this &mdash; there was more than enough food for all of us, and plenty for my daughter to sample &mdash; meaning she&#39;d pretend to try it and then surreptitiously remove it from her mouth. Portion sizes are pretty big, especially at à la carte table service and quick-service restaurants, so we never went hungry. What&#39;s the best age to take a kid to Disney World? There isn&#39;t one No, I did not let the 2-year-old keep the pin. Caralynn Matassa/Business Insider I know this isn&#39;t a very satisfying answer, but at the end of the day, the best age for a first Disney trip is extremely variable. While we were limited in what we could do with my toddler in terms of certain rides, experiences, and restaurants, there was plenty still available to us. And the rider swap option, which allows one parent to wait with the child and then swap to ride without waiting in line separately, was also very helpful in still allowing me to ride my favorite rides. Do I regret taking my 2-year-old to Disney World? Not at all. It wasn&#39;t the trip I&#39;d imagined, but it was still plenty magical &mdash; largely because the things that were magical to her were things I didn&#39;t expect or things I hadn&#39;t even experienced before. I&#39;m reminded of seeing her face light up meeting princesses or chowing down on a Mickey-shaped treat every time she bops me in the head with her prized Olaf bubble wand. My only hope is that next time she&#39;ll be brave enough to share a Dole Whip with me. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "US Marines are seen between the bars of the fence along the US-Mexico border. Denis Poroy/AP The Trump administration is using US troops and military assets in its costly immigration crackdown. Navy warships, military aircraft, and combat vehicles have been deployed to the US-Mexico border. The Pentagon has spent $376 million on militarizing the southern US border since January 20. US Navy destroyers are cruising coastal waters, spy planes are flying overhead, and troops are out patrolling desert trails in armored fighting vehicles. America&#39;s southern border is starting to resemble a military front line as the Trump administration ramps up its crackdown on illegal immigration at the divide between the US and Mexico . President Donald Trump swiftly put his mass deportation plan into motion after taking office, using US military personnel and assets to execute it by formally declaring illegal immigration a federal emergency. About 10,000 active-duty troops have been deployed to support the Pentagon&#39;s southern border operation , as have two warships, a handful of military aircraft, and over 100 combat vehicles. Costly crackdown on immigration US Army soldiers talk with the driver of a Border Patrol car near the fence at the southern US border. US Army by Pfc. Malik Waddy-Fiffee On April 1, Defense Department officials said the militarization at the US-Mexico border had cost roughly $376 million since Trump returned to the White House on January 20, or about $5.3 million per day. After making illegal immigration a major campaign issue, with Trump criticizing Biden&#39;s border policies, the Trump White House has touted plummeting numbers of illicit border crossings. US Customs and Border Patrol reported that March saw the lowest number of attempted crossings in decades. Illegal immigration was already on the decline prior to the start of Trump&#39;s second term, but the president is taking things further. He&#39;s got numerous military assets at the border. Here&#39;s what the administration has deployed. Thousands of troops US Army soldiers stand near the fence at the southern US border with Mexico. David Swanson/AFP via Getty Images During a House Armed Services Committee hearing on April 1, Pentagon officials said 6,700 active-duty troops had been deployed to the US-Mexico border , in addition to about 2,500 National Guardsmen that were already stationed there. Only Border Patrol agents or civilian law enforcement can actually apprehend migrants, leaving a large majority of the troops tasked with &#34;detection and monitoring,&#34; Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of the US Northern Command, said. Active-duty forces are limited in their actions on US soil. The general said that deployed military personnel &#34;operating in close proximity to the border&#34; are armed with rifles or pistols, and military officials are seeking authorization for troops to shoot down suspected cartel drones surveilling the border. USS Gravely Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely is moored at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Ryan Williams Two Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers &mdash; USS Gravely and USS Spruance &mdash; have also been deployed to help &#34;restore territorial integrity at the US southern border,&#34; officials said in two statements in March. &#34;Gravely&#39;s sea-going capacity improves our ability to protect the United States&#39; territorial integrity, sovereignty, and security,&#34; Guillot said. The destroyer departed Yorktown, Virginia, in mid-March to waters off the Texas coast to support the border mission and counter maritime weapons and drug crime in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gravely played a key role in Red Sea combat prior to this deployment. In December 2023, USS Gravely shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles and was involved in sinking three Houthi small boats, marking the first time the US Navy killed Houthi fighters since the Red Sea conflict began. USS Spruance The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Spruance sails through the Pacific Ocean. US Navy photo by Naval Air Crewman (Helicopter) 2nd class Diego Aiello A second Navy destroyer, USS Spruance , which also saw combat in the Red Sea, left its homeport in San Diego last month to patrol waters off the West Coast as part of the border operation. Guillot said that the warship &#34;brings additional capability and expands the geography of unique military capabilities working with the Department of Homeland Security.&#34; &#34;With Spruance off the West Coast and USS Gravely in the Gulf of America, our maritime presence contributes to the all-domain, coordinated DOD response to the Presidential Executive Order and demonstrates our resolve to achieve operational control of the border,&#34; the general added. The warships have been conducting operations alongside the Coast Guard. Airlifters flying deportation flights A line of men board a C-17 Globemaster Air Force plane sitting on a tarmac with a blue sky in the background. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt Migrant deportations are typically carried out using civilian charter flights operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump administration supplemented the deportation effort by using military cargo aircraft, like the C-17 Globemaster and C-130 Hercules , to transport migrants to Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, and even India. Military vs civilian flight costs US Transportation Command personnel are seen in the cargo bay of a C-17 Globemaster tasked with deporting migrants. US Army photo by Pfc. Kelvineisha Buck But the military aircraft, which are designed to transport both troops and cargo, come with a steep operational price tag. It costs about $28,000 per flight for one deportation on a C-17, whereas civilian flights cost an estimated $8,500. Following backlash from Democratic lawmakers, the Trump administration halted military deportation flights in early March. Though there are no further flights scheduled, Air Force Gen. Randall Reed told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that his command is prepared to carry them out should the order be reversed. &#34;If I get the task, I&#39;ll absolutely fly it,&#34; Reed said. Surveillance aircraft and drones A drone rolls on the tarmac at Fort Huachuca at the southern US border with Mexico. David Swanson/AFP via Getty Images The big cargo planes aren&#39;t the only military aircraft being used at the southern US border. Spy planes and drones have been conducting regular intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance flights. Reconnaissance aircraft like the U-2 &#34;Dragon Lady&#34; and Boeing RC-135 Rivet Joint have been used for ISR missions above Mexico. The Navy has also reportedly used Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime reconnaissance aircraft to conduct maritime patrol and surveillance along the US-Mexico border. Additionally, there have been reports of MQ-9 Reaper drones conducting flights as well. The Reaper is an uncrewed surveillance and combat asset. The Trump administration also directed Pentagon intelligence agencies to direct satellite surveillance to the southern border region, Reuters reported last month. Armored vehicles US Army soldiers walk near an Infantry Carrier Vehicle stationed near the southern US border. Ross D. Franklin/AP Border patrol agents typically drive SUVs, sedans, and pick-up trucks donning a green-and-white paint scheme to traverse the rugged terrain at the border. But as more active-duty troops are deployed to the region, armored tactical vehicles have become a regular sight in an apparent intimidation tactic. &#34;This sends a clear and unequivocal message to the criminal organizations operating on either side of the border that we will not tolerate illegal incursions or illicit activities along our border,&#34; Border Patrol spokesman Claudio Herrera-Baeza said. He added that &#34;these vehicles have incredible detection technology that the Border Patrol will incorporate into its mission of safeguarding our borders.&#34; &#39;More military assets&#39; A US Army sergeant rides in a Stryker armored vehicle next to a Border Patrol vehicle. US Army photo by Sgt. Griffin Payne The US Army sent over 100 Stryker armored fighting vehicles , along with hundreds of soldiers, to an installation near the border between Yuma, Arizona, and El Paso, Texas. Black Hawk helicopters and Chinooks for support aviation were also deployed. Typically deployed to warzones, the 20-ton eight-wheeled Stryker combat vehicles can be armed with a machine gun or grenade launcher and carry up to 11 troops. They can also reach speeds of up to 60 mph and have a range of 300 miles. &#34;That&#39;s really what we&#39;re doing with the Stryker out here,&#34; Lt. Col. Travis Stellfox told Scripps News . &#34;It provides us great mobility to get soldiers where they need to be to observe on the border.&#34; There is always the possibility more military assets could be deployed. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said previously that &#34;whatever is needed at the border will be provided.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "I went to an autonomous vehicle hype conference in LA and now I know why we won't lose human drivers anytime soon",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rideai-autonomous-vehicle-conference-review-2025-4",
    "description": "Ride AI hosted some of the top players in autonomous mobility at conference in Los Angeles. Courtesy Ride AI Ride AI hosted its first autonomous vehicle conference in LA, featuring some top AV players. Companies like Waymo have demonstrated the real-world applications of AI and autonomous driving. But human drivers are still very much in play, at least for the next few decades. Here&#39;s why. My day at an autonomous vehicle conference in Los Angeles started in a human-driven Uber . On a Wednesday morning, Waymo said it would take at least 15 minutes to snag a car for a five-minute ride to NeueHouse Hollywood, where Ride AI was hosting its first-ever autonomous vehicle summit, featuring some of the sector&#39;s leading players. I wasn&#39;t particularly in a time crunch, but, like most people, I don&#39;t call a rideshare driver half an hour or more before I leave the house to get to a destination. Exit app. Open Uber. It&#39;s fair to say that, at least for now, the battle between human and robot drivers is still raging. Stephen Hayes, Lyft&#39;s VP of autonomous operations, and Ryan Green, CEO of Gridwise &mdash; a platform for rideshare drivers to track their earnings &mdash; both said at the conference that the future of ride-hailing will look like a hybrid market of human and robot drivers . Lyft&#39;s vice president of autonomous, fleets, and driver operations, and Gridwise CEO Ryan Green. Courtesy Ride AI Green estimated that that&#39;ll be the case for at least the next 10 to 15 years. It may be Hayes&#39; and Green&#39;s prerogative to make such a claim. But that outlook made perfect sense to me &mdash; even as someone who has had great experiences in a Waymo &mdash; and appeared to resonate throughout the summit. A hybrid future Toyota Research Institute CEO Gill Pratt jumpstarted the event as the first speaker to say it&#39;s a &#34;myth that we need autonomy to help with terrible human driving.&#34; &#34;Humans are actually reasonably safe, pretty good drivers. For every hundred million miles there&#39;s an accident,&#34; Avinash Balachandran, TRI&#39;s VP of the Human Interacting Driving division, told me. &#34;Where we really see value for autonomy is this ability to help drivers in situations where they tend to struggle.&#34; Swag bags handed out at Ride AI Courtesy Ride AI For a conference centered entirely on the future of autonomous mobility, I was surprised that some of the top players in the AV field weren&#39;t throwing out rosy pictures or estimates of when robots will take over the wheel and our city roads. Tesla, whose CEO has made wild predictions like one million robotaxis by 2020, was noticeably absent from the conference but still came up during panel talks. Instead, voices from various autonomous mobility players, from ride-hailing to OEM software providers, spoke on the challenges of perfecting full self-driving technology and the still-fresh business opportunities for the human-driven vehicle segment. Amnon Shashua, CEO of Mobileye, talked about the lack of &#34;precision&#34; in AI, stemming partly from the need to perfect the application of redundancies and a lack of data. Over at Wayve , a UK-based autonomous driving software company, Kaity Fischer, the VP of commercial and operations, talked about the &#34;very large untapped market&#34; of level two and level three assisted and autonomous driving systems for consumer vehicles. Wayve&#39;s vice president of commercial and operations Kaity Fischer Courtesy Ride AI Both levels still need humans behind the wheel but with varying degrees of driver input. &#34;For the foreseeable future, there&#39;ll be a very long period of time where it&#39;s a hybrid solution of vehicle ownership intermingled with varying levels of autonomy, and those things all need to be able to coexist,&#34; Fisher told me when I asked her what she thought city streets will look like decades down the line. &#34;So levels two, three, and four all need to be able to share a space on the road and operate safely in conjunction.&#34; Christoph Lütge, an economist and AI ethics expert at the Technical University of Munich, told me that in Germany, where robotaxis exist only for limited testing, Level 3 driving is still not widely implemented. &#34;It should have happened already, but it&#39;s not really happening,&#34; he said. Riding the hype cycle This is not to underestimate the progress folks in San Francisco and other markets have &nbsp; experienced firsthand. One of the reasons everyone gathered in Los Angeles for an autonomous vehicle conference&nbsp;is undoubtedly because of Waymo. As Sophia Tung, a former engineer and now an AV-focused content creator, told me, we&#39;ve seen an autonomous vehicle hype cycle before &mdash; this time&#39;s just a bit different. Timothy B. Lee, one of the Ride AI moderators who has reported on transportation for Ars Technica before launching his Substack, Understanding AI, pointed to the Gartner hype cycle : Technological innovation first comes with the skyrocketing of what&#39;s called peak &#34;inflated expectations&#34; before crashing into a &#34;trough of disillusionment,&#34; then rising again, more gradually, on a &#34;slope of enlightenment&#34; followed by a &#34;plateau of productivity.&#34; Timothy B. Lee, tech reporter and one of the moderators of Ride AI. Ride AI The peak of inflated expectations happened around 2016 or &#39;17, Lee told me, before an Uber autonomous test vehicle killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in 2018. &#34;Then there was a period of three or four years, from 2018 to 2022 or so, when things were going very badly for these companies,&#34; he said. &#34;You had Uber shut down their program, Lyft shut down their program. Ford had Argo (AI) that shut down. That was a bad time to be in the industry and not as much fun to cover. And then, the last two years I would say it&#39;s been on the upswing pretty much since Waymo started expanding to San Francisco.&#34; Lee&#39;s prognosis is that the great human-driver replacement will be gradual. In the next 20-plus years, city roads will see fewer human drivers before they completely disappear. For example, he cited the decades it took before automatic elevators made human elevator operators obsolete. &#34;There&#39;s going to be a long process,&#34; he said. My day in Los Angeles ended with another human-driven rideshare, which arrived in the same amount of time it took to say goodbye to my friends, put on my shoes, and walk out of their apartment. The closest Waymo was 13 minutes away. Exit app. Open Uber. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "I was spending nearly $2,000 on groceries a month. When I handed the shopping over to my husband, he helped us save thousands.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/my-husband-helped-save-thousands-family-grocery-bill-2025-3",
    "description": "The offers and details on this page may have updated or changed since the time of publication. See our article on Business Insider for current information. The author&#39;s husband saved money on groceries by buying generic brands. Courtesy of Amy Braun My husband cut our $2,000 monthly grocery bill by $415 just by shopping differently. Switching from name brands to store brands saved us thousands &mdash; and my kids didn&#39;t even notice. His engineering mindset means no impulse buys and less food waste. In May 2023, my husband and I sat down to look over our budget app on his laptop &mdash; one of my least favorite activities. As a family of six living in the Chicago suburbs, our grocery bills were already sky-high and climbing with inflation. I hated budget conversations. Even though my husband never made me feel this way, I always felt like I was getting in trouble for overspending. So when he pointed out that our Walmart grocery bill for the month was $1,923, I felt the guilt creep in. But then, he said something that I didn&#39;t expect: &#34;Let me take over the grocery shopping.&#34; I laughed. Not because I thought he&#39;d do a bad job but because I couldn&#39;t imagine it would make any real difference. Plus, grocery shopping was my domain: I knew what we liked, and I meal planned. I didn&#39;t love the idea of him double-checking my choices. But I was exhausted from the weekly trips, so I handed him the grocery list &mdash; half expecting him to come back overwhelmed. The next month, our grocery bill dropped to $1,511. I figured he was just cutting corners to prove he could spend less. But the following month? $1,555. Our pantry was full, our kids were happy, and we were spending around $400 less a month. I had to admit: maybe my husband was onto something. He started by taking his time in the store to consider all the options I got curious about his method: &#34;How are you doing this?&#34; I asked. It turns out his first grocery shopping trip took almost two hours &mdash; and not because he couldn&#39;t find anything. While I was home imagining him wandering lost in the aisles, he was carefully reading ads (the ones I would have tossed aside) and checking prices on every single item. Ever the engineer, my husband pulled out his phone to show me some of the side-by-side price comparisons he made. I was beyond surprised. My husband made some big money-saving switches My kids go through ketchup like water. I had been buying Heinz at $4.48 for years without thinking twice. The Great Value brand my husband chose is just $1.92 for the same size bottle, and it tastes exactly the same, saving us $2.56 every time. The generic brand of ketchup is cheaper. Courtesy of Amy Braun But the ranch savings may be one of our biggest. Switching from Hidden Valley at $6.97 to Great Value at $3.54 saves us $3.43 per bottle, and no one can even tell the difference. We use it for everything from salads to dipping vegetables, so these savings add up quickly. We even did a blind taste test with our pickiest eater, and he liked the generic brand best. The cereal aisle turned out to have big savings, too. Name-brand Rice Krispies were costing us $3.98 per box, but Great Value Rice Crisps are only $1.97. This cut our cost in half while keeping breakfast the same. For the kids&#39; school snacks, I used to buy the individually packaged Goldfish for $9.76 out of convenience. My husband started buying the bulk carton for $7.79 which saves us almost $2.00 for even more crackers. For what we are saving, I don&#39;t mind taking the extra minute to put the Goldfish into individual baggies for school snacks . The generic brand of ranch is cheaper. Courtesy of Amy Braun It&#39;s not just about switching to store brands or buying in bulk. Even with name-brand things we love, my husband finds a way to save money. For example, with our coffee, instead of paying $31.08 at Walmart for three pounds, he gets it directly from Dunkin on his way home for $26.21. That&#39;s saving $4.87 just by changing where we buy it. It&#39;s the exact same amount, but almost $5.00 cheaper. We&#39;re happier and saving money There have been unexpected benefits beyond just saving money. I no longer dread those weekly grocery trips because I&#39;m not making them anymore. Since my husband actually sticks to the grocery list (unlike me and my impulse purchases), we&#39;re wasting less food. I still handle meal planning , but he approaches grocery shopping with his engineering mindset. I wish we&#39;d made this switch years ago. It&#39;s funny how sometimes the best solutions come from playing to each other&#39;s strengths and letting the more cost-conscious partner do the shopping. That one conversation didn&#39;t just change how we grocery shop &mdash; it&#39;s saving our family about $4,980 a year. And, all because I was willing to hand over the grocery list to my husband, who was willing to spend two hours comparing ketchup prices. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Satellite imagery shows how cruise line private islands and resorts have changed the Caribbean landscape. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Cruise lines like MSC, Carnival, and Royal Caribbean own resorts and private islands throughout the Caribbean. They&#39;re increasingly upgrading their properties and expanding their real estate portfolios. Satellite imagery shows how cruise lines have changed the Caribbean landscape. A decade ago, Ocean Cay, a Bahamian island 65 miles from Miami&#39;s coastline, stood abandoned, bearing the scars of its previous life as an industrial sand mining site. These days, the 95-acre island looks less like an excavation facility and more like a slice of Caribbean paradise. Gone are the debris and floating metal fragments. Now a vacation destination, Ocean Cay is home to seven pristine beaches, waterfront cabanas, and family-fun activities &mdash; all thanks to a $500 million investment from MSC Cruises . Satellite imagery shows how MSC&#39;s Ocean Cay has evolved from 2016 to 2021 to 2025. Planet Labs PBC&#39; In 2019, after three years of cleanup and development, MSC opened the island as Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve, a private retreat exclusively for its cruise passengers. It now sees thousands of travelers virtually every day of the year, many of whom are ready to spend big on a swim with stingrays and a beachside massage. Cruise lines like MSC, Carnival, and Royal Caribbean collectively own 17 ports and resorts in the Caribbean. Some are still under development as these at-sea vacation companies increasingly build back onshore, transforming swaths of the warm-weathered landscape into unrecognizable but highly profitable exclusive vacation destinations . The transformation of neighboring rivals About 85 miles from Ocean Cay, Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings have claimed two private islands separated only by a mile-long stretch of the Atlantic Ocean. Norwegian was an early trendsetter, having been the first cruise line to acquire an island, now known as Great Stirrup Cay, for its guests in 1977. The company has recently upgraded its 270-acre buildout, expanding the dining and walkways in 2017 and launching a luxurious hotel-like retreat in 2019. Satellite imagery shows how neighboring cruise-owned islands, Royal Caribbean&#39;s Perfect Day at CocoCay and Norwegian&#39;s Great Stirrup Cay, have changed from 2016 to 2024. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Later this year, Great Stirrup Cay is also expected to debut a new pier that can concurrently accommodate two of Norwegian&#39;s largest ships &mdash; a $150 million investment in an attempt to rival its successful neighbor, Royal Caribbean&#39;s Perfect Day at CocoCay . Like Ocean Cay, their locations are strategic. Perfect Day at CocoCay and Great Stirrup Cay are less than a day&#39;s sail from Florida&#39;s busy ports, allowing the companies to save on increasingly costly fuel expenses. A closer look at CocoCay CocoCay is as much a &#34;perfect day&#34; as it is a perfect investment, having opened in 2019 as a resort-like extension of Royal Caribbean&#39;s splashy ships. The more than 130-acre island has since become a massive hit, accommodating almost all of the company&#39;s Caribbean cruise guests with its waterpark, lounge-lined beaches, and, as of last year, an adult-only beach club . Royal Caribbean&#39;s Perfect Day at CocoCay in 2016. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Royal Caribbean&#39;s Perfect Day at CocoCay in 2024. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies The cruise line has poured a cool $350 million into developing the property. Yet, amid strong guest demand, financial returns have been &#34;exceptionally high and significantly above its target,&#34; Naftali Holtz, the CFO of Royal Caribbean Group, told analysts in 2023. It&#39;s now hoping to replicate CocoCay&#39;s success with a private resort 63 miles away on Paradise Island, located just offshore from Nassau, Bahamas, and near Atlantis&#39; sprawling resort. Royal Caribbean began purchasing land on Paradise Island in early 2017 . Seven years later, it started developing the 17-acre property into what would soon become its first Royal Beach Club , a sprawling exclusive resort. Satellite imagery shows the site of Royal Caribbean&#39;s Royal Beach Club in 2022 and 2025. Planet Labs PBC&#39; Royal Beach Club Paradise Island is scheduled to open in December 2025. Guests will have to pay to enter the all-inclusive property. Once inside, they can expect access to 10 bars, shopping, cabanas, and several pools and beaches, including some for families. Another island, another resort In addition to expanding its island &mdash; RelaxAway, Half Moon Cay &mdash; Carnival Corp is also following the private resort strategy with a mile-long getaway on Grand Bahama Island . Celebration Key , as it&#39;s been dubbed, is scheduled to begin welcoming Carnival cruisers in July. The land is expected to be transformed into a vacation hub with beach clubs, a family lagoon, and plenty of dining options &mdash; &#34;clearly following Royal Caribbean&#39;s footsteps,&#34; Patrick Scholes, lodging and leisure research analyst at Truist Securities, told Business Insider in 2024. Satellite images show the site of Carnival&#39;s Celebration Key in 2016, 2023, and 2025. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Satellite imagery shows the site of Celebration Key in March 2025. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies The resort is expected to accommodate 4 million visitors annually when Carnival builds two additional berths in 2028. The $600 million project is set to be the company&#39;s largest. Yet, Carnival Corp&#39;s CFO, David Bernstein, told analysts in 2024 that Celebration Key is already expected to be a &#34;smash hit and provide an excellent return on investment. &#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "There are a few things I wish I had known before going on my first African safari. Carly Caramanna My husband and I went on our first African safari last year. The bucket-list trip was incredible, but there are a few things I wish I had known before we left. I didn&#39;t realize how different each safari drive would be or that I should&#39;ve packed differently. Last year, my husband and I took a 10-day guided group tour of South Africa with Adventures By Disney. Part of the trip included a three-day African safari at the Kapama River Lodge, a luxury safari resort on the Kapama Game Reserve near Kruger National Park. Even though most of the trip&#39;s schedule and transportation details were planned for us through the tour group, it was our first time in South Africa &mdash; and our first time on safari in general. Needless to say, we weren&#39;t totally prepared for what the experience would entail. Here are the five things I wish I had known before going on the trip. I should have packed more layers. I wish I had more than one hat on the trip. Carly Caramanna We went on safari in August, which is Africa&#39;s winter. During this time of year, the temperature can fluctuate greatly during the course of a day. Even after researching the weather patterns, the range in temperature caught me off guard. For example, our morning safaris were very cold, but by early afternoon, it became T-shirt weather. I mainly brought sweaters for the trip, but looking back, I would have focused on packing layers instead. I also found headgear to be absolutely vital for blocking the sun and keeping my hair from getting unruly in the wind. On my next trip, I&#39;ll definitely bring more than one hat with me. I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d want to spend more time at our resort. Our resort was stunning, but I packed too much into our schedule to enjoy it. Carly Caramanna While planning the trip, I was so focused on the safari experience that I didn&#39;t realize how amazing our resort would be. With its beautiful spa and gourmet dining options, it felt like an all-inclusive resort . Three days there was not nearly enough time. Next time, I&#39;d carve out additional time to explore the lodge&#39;s restaurant, spa, and amenities in more depth. Each safari drive offered something unique. I went on two safari drives each day. Carly Caramanna As part of our vacation package , we were able to go on two safaris each day: one in the morning and one in the evening. Ahead of the trip, I had a preconceived notion that things would get redundant. However, that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t skip any of the safaris because I was able to see all of the Big 5 animals: lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants, and African buffalo. Night rides ended up being my favorite as we stopped in the middle of the bush for a happy hour at a makeshift bar. If I had only gone on the daytime rides, I would have missed this entire experience. It would&#39;ve been nice to have a professional camera. We saw a beautiful rhinoceros on our safari. Carly Caramanna I had no idea just how many animals we would spot and how close we would get &mdash; sometimes, within several yards. Although there&#39;s definitely value in enjoying a moment, I do regret not bringing a professional camera on at least a few safari rides to get incredible photos. I had no reason to be stressed before the trip. I loved my safari experience &mdash; mistakes and all. Carly Caramanna &#34;Bucket list&#34; isn&#39;t a term I take lightly, but I absolutely feel comfortable labeling this trip as such. This was the most outside-of-my-comfort-zone vacation I&#39;ve taken to date. I knew very little about what to expect and was worried about letting others take control of the planning. However, it ended up being one of the best trips I&#39;ve ever taken, and I wish I&#39;d gone into it less stressed. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/young-widow-financially-prepared-life-insurance-2025-4",
    "description": "The author (not pictured) was 46 when she became a widow. simonapilolla/Getty Images My husband died when I was 46, and I received a wake-up call about financial preparedness. His life insurance policy was a lifesaver as I developed a more long-term plan for our family. I sought professional advice to get through that time, and I&#39;m glad I did. In the wee hours of the morning, several days after my husband&#39;s death in 2003 from sudden cardiac arrest , I awoke out of breath, my heart racing. Would my daughters be able to stay in their schools? Could I continue to pay the mortgage on our home? When my husband accepted his first overseas diplomatic assignment, I gave up my career. Once back in the States, I began to slowly rebuild my professional life, but I was far behind my peers in earning power and savings. Still, I didn&#39;t worry too much about our income and my slow-growing 403b. We weren&#39;t diligent savers; we had mortgages, car loans, and two children in private schools . We relied on the assumption that Uncle Sam had our backs. Insurance was a lifesaver for me during that time Suddenly, with a base salary of $42,000 a year, I became responsible for my two teenage daughters and, as an only child, my elderly mom. My husband had good life insurance in place (with his morbid sense of humor, he often joked about how &#34;well off&#34; I&#39;d be when he died), which was a godsend, but I needed to understand how to use our money efficiently. Most financial experts say you should have enough money in your emergency savings fund to cover three to six months&#39; worth of living expenses. Being unprepared is exacerbated if you are not used to navigating the finances. In my case, I was aware of our position in general terms, but large decisions, such as our daughters&#39; education and buying or selling a home or vehicle, were always joint. As my husband&#39;s beneficiary, I received his federal life insurance payout. Early on, I received incorrect information, leading me to believe that I needed to keep the insurance payout I received in the low-interest settlement account. Learning that I was able to move it to an account that delivered a higher rate of return eased a lot of stress. My initial priority was not investing but making sure I had enough money coming in to pay our bills. I chose to work with an advisor at our credit union to invest the money in instruments that would conserve &mdash; and hopefully increase &mdash; my principal and provide an income stream to supplement my small salary. I developed a long-term financial plan My advisor suggested investments that would help me achieve the goals we had planned for our daughters. I was happy to learn I&#39;d be able to keep my younger daughter in parochial high school and enable my older daughter to remain at her current college. Next, I paid off some high-interest items with part of the insurance money, which eased the burden on my modest income and saved me from having to make large draws from our investment accounts . Later, I tackled estate planning issues such as updating my own will and beneficiaries on all financial items. Even though I knew how to access our bill-paying software and bank accounts, having no real savings of my own and a meager retirement plan due to contributions of only the 10 years we&#39;d been back in the States made me anxious. The reality of planning a possible solo retirement made me again wish I&#39;d been wiser about my personal saving practices. Soon after tragedy strikes, many widows and widowers rush to make huge &mdash; and sometimes unwise &mdash; major financial decisions. A short time after my husband&#39;s death, I considered selling our home . but an accountant friend advised me to wait until I was on steadier emotional ground. I&#39;m glad I did because the house appreciated in value, and I was able to secure a good price when I did sell it 15 years later. I learned a lot about financial preparedness when I became a young widow In my grief support group, I saw firsthand others having to sell homes or move in with family after losing a spouse or partner&#39;s income. I know I was fortunate because of my husband&#39;s foresight in planning for a future that did not include him. Because my life insurance had always come as a benefit of my employment, I purchased additional insurance to guarantee that the girls would have some assets should my financial situation change, or I could no longer work. Even though I learned a lot by becoming a young widow , I wish I&#39;d known more about financial planning before tragedy struck. Having to shoulder the weight of a family&#39;s financial present and future only added to my already fragile emotional state. At least, seeking both professional and personal help and a dose of strategic planning eased one of the burdens I felt immediately after my husband&#39;s death.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-taking-overnight-kyiv-express-to-ukraine-2025-4",
    "description": "My train from the platform. Jake Epstein/Business Insider I recently took the 16-hour overnight train from Warsaw to Kyiv for a reporting trip. The &#39;Kyiv Express&#39; was loud and bumpy but surprisingly cozy. This is what the long journey was like. WARSAW, Poland &mdash; When I boarded the big blue train that took me on a 16-hour journey into Ukraine, I was certain I wasn&#39;t going to be getting any sleep. The makeshift beds rattled throughout the night as we barreled across the Polish and, eventually, Ukrainian countryside. The train stopped frequently, and passport checks interrupted hopes of grabbing some proper shut-eye. Last month, I spent about a week in Kyiv reporting on Russia&#39;s ongoing invasion . I felt that as a journalist covering the war, I needed to be there, to see things myself, and to learn what the people of Ukraine are facing. It was eye-opening. I experienced the uncertainty of waiting out a Russian barrage in an air-raid shelter in the middle of the night. Many Ukrainians in the capital are desensitized to the near-daily one-way attack drones and won&#39;t even get out of bed for those, but the missiles still cause alarm. I met air defenders shooting threats with a machine gun out of a pickup truck. And I saw firsthand the efforts to produce new types of drones for front-line combat. Getting to Ukraine, though, from neighboring Poland meant an overnight train ride, one unlike anything I had experienced before in the US or in Europe. At the busy train station in Warsaw, a platform sign identified my ride as the &#34;Kyiv Express.&#34; Waiting in warsaw Waiting for my train at Warsaw Wschodnia station. Jake Epstein/Business Insider I arrived at the Warsaw Wschodnia station an hour before my scheduled departure, giving me time to relax and grab a bite to eat. After hanging out and watching people flood in and out of the station, I devoured a small sandwich from Caffè Nero. It was evening, just a bit before 6 p.m. I got to the platform a few minutes early and walked to my assigned train car, showing my ticket to an employee of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine&#39;s state-owned rail company. Boarding the &#34;Kyiv Express&#34; My train from the platform. Jake Epstein/Business Insider I boarded the train and walked to my sleeper cabin at the end of the car, right next to one of the two bathrooms. The blue train was dimly lit, dated, and had a stale odor. My room was the size of a large closet, but I had it all to myself, and it felt surprisingly cozy. I hung my coat and took a few minutes to get settled and organize my things. The room had a three-bed bunk, with the middle bed swung down to act as a backrest for the bottom bed, where one would sit (eventually, I raised the middle bed to sleep on). Besides the only window, there were some hangers, a small fold-down chair, a ladder, a storage rack, and a small desk with a mirror that opened and hosted an electrical outlet. It was a spartan space, certainly not the luxury train Western leaders have used to travel into Ukraine in the past, but it was sufficient for what I needed it to do. Sleeper cars My cabin for the next 16 hours. Jake Epstein/Business Insider My train cabin The other view of my cabin. There was a desk in the corner, so I could do a little work. Jake Epstein/Business Insider The cabin was equipped with three plastic packets containing sheets, a pillowcase, and a towel. What looked like sleeping pads and pillows were on the top bunk, and blankets were on a storage rack. (I didn&#39;t end up using any of them.) The cabin also came stocked with two bottles of water, but I&#39;d packed my own, along with some Pringles, biscuits, and Mentos to hold me over until I got to Kyiv. I figured there was a good chance I&#39;d be up all night and get hungry. Just me and my bags I had my backpack, camera bag, suitcase, and two duffle bags with gear and other supplies. Jake Epstein/Business Insider Everything I needed The top bunk had some extra stuff for sleeping. Jake Epstein/Business Insider The train pulled away from the station shortly after its scheduled departure time. By this point, it was dark outside. Around 15 minutes later, someone came by to check my tickets. I used Google Translate to communicate with him, and he tried to speak English at one point. The only word I could really make out from the exchange was &#34; Trump .&#34; My reporting trip came right after a contentious White House meeting between the US president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and as the Trump administration was pressuring Ukraine to make unfavorable deals. The train felt like it was traveling fast, though I had no idea what our speed was. They may have said something, but I don&#39;t speak Ukrainian. The journey across Poland was bumpy and loud. During the first three hours of my ride, I prepped for interviews in Kyiv , caught up on the news, ate some snacks, and watched a little TV on my phone. The cell coverage was surprisingly good at this point (it got worse). Bathroom controls This control panel allowed me to adjust the lighting, and I could see when either of the two bathrooms in my train car was occupied. Jake Epstein/Business Insider Bigger than an airplane bathroom The bathroom. Jake Epstein/Business Insider It was dark outside, so I couldn&#39;t see much of Poland beyond some scattered homes, buildings, and streetlights. Every so often, the train stopped briefly at a station as we inched closer to Ukraine. Polish customs began a little after 9:30 p.m., nearly four hours into the journey. A customs officer walked down the hall to check passports and clock us out of the European Union. The train didn&#39;t move for over an hour, but eventually, it started rolling again. Ten minutes later, I received a knock from an employee saying that we had reached Ukrainian customs. The couch functions as a bed I put a sheet on the bottom bunk so I could lie down for a bit. Jake Epstein/Business Insider More than one place to sleep Eventually, I hoisted up the middle bunk and tried to sleep there. Jake Epstein/Business Insider Narrow hallways The narrow hallway in my train car. It had several sleeping cabins like mine. Jake Epstein/Business Insider I handed over my passport to a Ukrainian soldier and got it back 30 minutes later with my long-awaited Ukrainian stamp. By this point, with the time change (Ukraine is one hour ahead of Poland), it was nearly 1 a.m., and I was super tired. Twenty minutes later, we entered a massive warehouse, where the train underwent preparation to switch from European tracks to the wider Ukrainian tracks built during the Soviet Union. Though Russia&#39;s army has struck train tracks and rail centers, Ukraine&#39;s rail lines have been surprisingly well maintained, with most trains running on schedule . The next hour was filled with the unenjoyable, piercing sounds of machinery and the coughing and snoring that penetrated the thin walls separating my room and the one next door. Closing in on Kyiv My view out the window as we got closer to Kyiv. Jake Epstein/Business Insider First sights of the Ukrainian capital city The first views of Kyiv. Jake Epstein/Business Insider Stepping off at my stop Stepping off the train at Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi station. Jake Epstein/Business Insider For the next few hours after we finally got on our way again, our train zipped across the Ukrainian countryside. I was in and out of sleep, but when the sun rose, I gave up entirely and took my first view of the eastern European country out the window. As we approached the Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi station, the landscape slowly shifted from rural to urban, and we arrived in the Ukrainian capital just before 11 a.m. It was chilly and busy outside as I waited for a ride to my hotel. Stepping out onto the ordinary-looking concrete station, I reveled in the fresh air before it dawned on me that I still had the same 16-hour journey back to Warsaw to look forward to.

    "title": "I was an email hoarder until it got out of control. Here are 7 quick ways I cleaned up my inbox and freed up storage space.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-free-google-storage-space-clean-gmail-inbox-fast-2025-4",
    "description": "The first step to cleaning up your Gmail inbox is to admit you&#39;re an email hoarder. chaofann/Getty Images I ran out of Google storage space because my Gmail inbox was flooded with unread messages. To continue receiving new emails, I had to delete over 30,000 older ones. Filtering messages, unsubscribing from email lists, and mass-deleting convos quickly freed up space. After I completely maxed out of Gmail storage space , I was forced to admit that I&#39;m an email hoarder. If you can relate to this condition, then you might be on the verge of having your Google storage completely filled, and you&#39;re probably days away from not being able to receive any more emailed messages &mdash; unless you pay for more space . The problem could be several things, but for me, it was the over 30,000 unread emails sitting in my inbox. Whatever the issue might be, there are many things we can&#39;t control in this world; thankfully, our Gmail inbox is not one of them. Here&#39;s how I freed up my storage space and made my inbox more manageable. Step 1: Admit you have a problem. Screenshot courtesy of Manseen Logan/Google After I received a notice from Google explaining that the company would no longer tolerate my recklessness, I had to address my email-hoarding behavior and start deleting messages. In reality, the notice told me that I was &#34;out of storage and would stop receiving emails in 29 days,&#34; but I took it as an eye-opener on how poorly I&#39;d been managing my inbox. Sometimes, items in Google Drive or Google Photos can cause storage space to run out, but in my case, my inbox was the problem. Step 2: Carve out time to start tackling the issue. Screenshot courtesy of Manseen Logan/Google Cleaning and managing Gmail is an ongoing process, but as the popular Chinese proverb goes, &#34;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&#34; I decided to take an hour or two on the weekend to begin tackling my inbox. That day, I freed up 20% of my Google storage space and made a conscious decision to replace some of the time I spent doom scrolling on social media with deleting emails from my Gmail account going forward. Step 3: Begin with the Promotions section of your Gmail account. Screenshot courtesy of Manseen Logan The Promotions category is the easiest place to start deleting emails. Nine out of 10 chances, you won&#39;t remember signing up for any of those deals. I had over 16,000 deals from as far back as 2018 that had never been opened &mdash; featuring things that I&#39;d never buy . I don&#39;t even know how most of these promotions found me. Gmail allowed me to select up to 50 messages to delete on each page and gave me the option to clear out every conversation from the promotions category. I deleted a couple of pages first before choosing to delete all conversations in the promotion section so I could remove myself from unwanted email lists. Step 4: Unsubscribe from email messages you no longer want to see. Screenshot courtesy of Manseen Logan/Google You could delete all of your emails in one or two clicks, but that&#39;s just a short-term solution to a bigger problem. Those same senders will have your inbox full the next day &mdash; and you could mistakenly delete something important. I chose to carefully sift through the first few pages of my promotions folder and proactively unsubscribe from unwanted newsletters. Gmail makes this easy. I just hovered the mouse over each email message, and if the option to unsubscribe was available, a box that said &#34;unsubscribe&#34; popped up. I clicked that box and was all set. This allowed me to unsubscribe from dozens of email lists in seconds. Step 5: Mass-delete unwanted emails. Screenshot courtesy of Manseen Logan/Google After looking through my most recent promotion emails, I selected everything and sent it to the trash. This process was easy, but mass-deleting emails from my primary inbox took a bit more tact. I scanned through each email page, and every time I came across a reoccurring message that I never opened &mdash; like messages from that one dance camp I registered my niece for three years ago &mdash; I&#39;d unsubscribe from that email list. Then, I typed the sender&#39;s name or email address into the email search box at the top of Gmail and placed quotation marks around it. That usually brought up all of the emails I received from that sender. From there, I selected all the messages and mass-deleted them. You can repeat these steps in your &#34;social&#34; and &#34;updates&#34; folder, too. Step 6: Don&#39;t forget to empty your trash. Screenshot courtesy of Manseen Logan/Google If you forget to empty the trash folder, you could delete every email from your inbox, but that wouldn&#39;t free up an inch of storage space. The trash folder can usually be found by clicking on the Gmail menu in the upper left corner and scrolling down past the spam folder. Sometimes, you might need to click the &#34;more&#34; button after the drafts folder to reveal it. Once I opened the trash folder, I had the option to restore mistakenly deleted emails , select which emails to permanently delete, or &#34;empty trash now&#34; to get rid of everything in one quick swoop. I chose to delete all of the messages. Once deleted from the trash, they were gone for good. Step. 7 Enjoy your cleaner inbox and free storage space. Screenshot courtesy of Manseen Logan/Google After I worked through all of these steps, my inbox was much tidier and I avoided having to pay for extra storage space to receive new emails. It might sound like a lot, but it was effortless. My biggest lesson was to just let go and delete. We have enough to deal with in the real world. Why hold on to digital trash?

They also have two dogs, Baby and Paris. &#34;We purchased the house from the original owners, and it was built in the early &#39;70s,&#34; Lexi Poer told BI of the four-bedroom home. &#34;Everything was well-maintained and updated as needed, but we were able to come in and spend what we call the fun money on bringing it up to date aesthetically.&#34; They did some initial renovations on the property before moving into the house in March 2018. Poer had always dreamed of her mom moving in with her family, and in 2023, it felt like the right time to make the move. Sandra Vassell and her granddaughters. Strolling In The Suburbs Poer told BI that she and her mom, Sandra Vassell, 64, have always been close. Vassell raised her as a single mom , and Poer said she was clear with her husband in the early days of their relationship that she always planned for her mom to live with them someday. &#34;As a child, I always imagined having a compound with several houses in a cul-de-sac so we each had our own space but lived near each other,&#34; Poer said. &#34;My mom was just laughing, thinking I was crazy.&#34; In 2020, Poer and her family started thinking more about having Vassell live with them, as COVID made seeing each other difficult. Shortly after, when housing prices skyrocketed, it seemed like a sign that they should consolidate into one space. &#34;We figured out that she would be able to sell her home for far more than she purchased it not many years before that and invest that money into our home and building her own space,&#34; Poer said. &#34;That was the piece that made the dream a reality.&#34; It was important to the Poers and Vassell that everyone maintained their independence. They built a second home. Strolling In The Suburbs As the Poers started thinking about creating an in-law suite for Vassell in their home , maintaining her independence was a priority. &#34;She very much wanted to make sure that she had all of the things she needed to live independently in her space, like somewhere to park her car and enter her home without having to come through our house, access to the outdoor space without having to enter our house, her own laundry room, her own kitchen,&#34; Poer said. Likewise, the Poers liked entertaining friends and didn&#39;t want their social life to disrupt Vassell&#39;s routine. They decided to build a separate house for Vassell that attaches to the main house. The two homes connect. Strolling in the Suburbs Rather than building a separate guest house in a different area of their yard, the Poers and Vassell wanted the two homes to truly connect, both for curb appeal and to fit their lifestyle. &#34;We imagined when the girls wake up on Saturday morning, they always want to run down and go into Nana&#39;s house and watch cartoons or have breakfast with her,&#34; Poer said, as her daughters often spent weekends at their grandmother&#39;s house when she didn&#39;t live with them. They didn&#39;t want the kids to have to think about grabbing a jacket or rain boots to run across the yard, and they also wanted their dogs to be able to wander through the spaces. The houses form one structure, though the new addition has its own driveway and garage. The homes connect through a walk-in pantry in the Poers&#39; house. The butler&#39;s pantry connects the homes. Zachary Toth The new home is connected to the main house through a walk-in pantry that Poer and her mom use. &#34;It&#39;s where we put the things that neither of us needs daily but both want access to, and we didn&#39;t really feel like we needed double of everything,&#34; Poer said, pointing to items like a stand mixer or Christmas china. The space, which sits off the main house&#39;s kitchen, is lined with cabinets and counters. At the end of the hall, a door leads to Vassell&#39;s home. The connected entrance opens to the kitchen, mirroring the big house. The kitchens mirror each other. Zachary Toth Vassell&#39;s home is 1,000 square feet in total. From the exterior, the houses look like one building, though her area is completely self-sustaining. The door connecting her house to the main home doesn&#39;t have a lock, so the Poers and Vassell can come and go from each other&#39;s homes as they please. The kitchen features a large island and built-in cabinetry, and Vassell has her own butler&#39;s pantry in addition to the one she shares with the Poers. Her house features 16-foot vaulted ceilings that make it feel open and airy. An open-concept floor plan makes the home feel spacious. The living area. Zachary Toth Vassell&#39;s living room is open-concept , and she has an exterior door that leads to a shared patio outside the house. Because the house was customized to fit Vassell&#39;s needs, it has areas designed just for her, like a craft closet. &#34;She&#39;s a big crafter, so she has this dream craft closet that unfolds and can fold back up and holds all of her crafting storage,&#34; Poer said. Vassell&#39;s house also has its own washer and dryer, so she doesn&#39;t have to share with the rest of the family. Vassell&#39;s home has a special room for the girls. The &#34;snug&#34; room. Zachary Toth &#34;We call it the snug,&#34; Poer said of the 50-square-foot room, which is painted a soft pink and features a twin bed, toys, and keepsakes that belong to Poer&#39;s daughters. &#34;That is the girls&#39; space within Nana&#39;s house, and that was something they requested,&#34; Poer said. &#34;It was important for them to feel like they could still go over and have sleepovers with grandma because they love doing that.&#34; &#34;Long-term, it could totally be an additional storage space or an office or a little exercise space,&#34; she said. &#34;It could be multiple purposes when the kids outgrow that space.&#34; The bedroom is spacious, too. The primary suite. Zachary Toth A hallway leads to the bedroom suite, so it isn&#39;t right off the main living area. &#34;There&#39;s a bit more privacy for both the bedroom and the bathroom, and then between those, she has her large walk-in closet as well,&#34; Poer said. The bedroom has high ceilings, adding to the spacious feel. The Poers thought long-term when designing Vassell&#39;s bathroom. The bathroom is wheelchair accessible. Zachary Toth The bathroom was designed to be wheelchair accessible, so it will work for Vassell &mdash; or the Poers &mdash; if their mobility changes. &#34;We truly want this home to stay in the family,&#34; Lexi said. &#34;People don&#39;t do that nowadays. But I definitely feel like, with home prices and the way they&#39;re going, that is going to become more normal, especially when you have invested so much money into your home like we have.&#34; &#34;We always say, even when Nana&#39;s gone someday, my husband and I might end up moving into what is now Nana&#39;s house, and maybe one of the girls will want to take over our home,&#34; she said. &#34;We&#39;re definitely not forcing that on them but leaving the door open to explore.&#34; The Poers&#39; hope that they could pass the house down to their daughters is also part of why they didn&#39;t build a separate guest house, which might have given the property a higher resale value than a connected house. They wanted to create the future that worked for them, not a potential buyer. &#34;We have zero desire to move again, and my husband and I would be plenty content just living in that 1000 square feet once the girls are out of the house,&#34; Poer added. The Poers gave their home a major upgrade during the renovation, too. The primary bedroom in the main house. Zachary Toth While adding Vassell&#39;s home to their property, Poer and her husband also renovated the second floor of their house so it would better serve their family. They turned their original primary bedroom into two massive his-and-hers closets and built out an additional 500 square feet that became their new primary suite and luxurious laundry room. Poer said the original primary suite was dated, and although they had renovated it in 2017, it still didn&#39;t feel like it flowed with the rest of the house. &#34;It just felt like we&#39;re adding such an investment into this house that the primary suite needs to reflect that,&#34; she said. &#34;We felt making a larger, more modern-size primary bedroom and bathroom and then larger closets made the home value more what it should be overall, especially with adding the square footage.&#34; After the renovation , the house had five bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms. The renovation cost $350,000 in total. Lexi and Jordan Poer&#39;s new bathroom suite. Zachary Toth Poer said Vassell&#39;s home was built for around $200,000, and the renovations to the second floor of the main house cost around $150,000. Although the renovation was costly, the project has saved the Poer family money day to day since they only have one household that three adults pay into. &#34;Sure, electricity goes up, but it doesn&#39;t double,&#34; Lexi said. &#34;It&#39;s still not you&#39;re like you&#39;re paying two electric bills. It&#39;s just one slightly higher electric bill and the same with all utilities.&#34; Plus, the trio has three income sources they can draw from if something breaks in Vassell&#39;s home, and Poer said they&#39;re already saving money on groceries and wasting less food. Poer also said their living arrangements save her and her mom time. &#34;Instead of her having to clean her house and I have to clean my house, we can have a day where we&#39;re cleaning up the house,&#34; Poer said. &#34;Now, that takes time off of both of our plates to then be able to garden together or go to get coffee together or something like that.&#34; Poer and her whole family are closer than ever now that they live together. They love sharing a home. Strolling In The Suburbs &#34;We&#39;re able to do things more often together than we did before,&#34; Poer said, adding that it&#39;s easy for her mom to be part of little &#34;family moments&#34; daily. &#34;She&#39;s at every single sporting event because she just hops in the car with us and goes. Or if we&#39;re watching &#39;Harry Potter&#39; for the first time, she&#39;s able to make popcorn and pop over,&#34; Poer said. &#34;She&#39;s able to witness more of those core memory moments with her grandkids, and she and I are able to spend more time together when the kids are at school together.&#34; Poer and her mom&#39;s close relationship helped make the transition to sharing a property easy. Still, she also credits their design process with ensuring the home and the in-law suite work for their whole family. She said combining households is smoothest when you balance people&#39;s independence with &#34;the value each person brings into the whole family dynamic.&#34; &#34;Everyone wants to still feel like they have their home and it&#39;s their safe space, their comfort zone,&#34; she said. Poer hopes more families in the US embrace multigenerational living. Lexi Poer loves multigenerational living. Strolling In The Suburbs &#34;It&#39;s not a new concept,&#34; she said. &#34;It&#39;s been around in so many cultures.&#34; Poer said she is excited to see more people creating multigenerational homes, and she loves sharing her experience with it on social media to help others see how easy it can be to make it work for their families. &#34;I think as a society, one of our biggest things that we&#39;re going to have to get through is this culture of isolation that phones and electronics and we&#39;ve created for ourselves, and what better way to do that than just having your family surround you and love on you and be your built-in community right in your house,&#34; Poer said.

    "description": "Edge Esmeralda, pictured above, is a pop-up retreat that represents what the future town of Esmeralda hopes to be. Devon Zuegel/Edge Esmeralda Devon Zuegel, a San Francisco tech worker, longed to live in more of a community. She is building Esmeralda, a small city in Sonoma Wine Country. She hosts Edge Esmeralda, a pop-up event to give people an idea of what Esmeralda could look like. Devon Zuegel graduated from Stanford and moved to San Francisco in 2016 for her software engineering career. Then, the pandemic hit. Zuegel and her husband temporarily relocated to Chautauqua , the New York lake resort town where her grandmother lived, and Zuegel visited as a child. In the summer, the tiny village blossoms into a kind of utopia &mdash; walkable, family-friendly, and brimming with culture. Up to 7,500 people flock to spend their days hopping between plays, symphony performances, and lectures. One night, Zuegel&#39;s husband wondered aloud: &#34;Why aren&#39;t there more places like this?&#34; That moment is &#34;burned into my retinas,&#34; Zuegel told Business Insider. The Chautauqua Institution becomes a summer utopia for thousands of families each year. woodsnorthphoto/Shutterstock That was the start of Esmeralda, a small town Zuegel is building in the Sonoma Wine Country, about 90 minutes north of San Francisco. Zuegel drew inspiration from Chautauqua and similar walkable communities, such as Vail in Colorado, Charleston in South Carolina, and Arizona&#39;s new car-free neighborhood . The goal, Zuegel told BI, is to build a primarily walkable and bikeable town within the city of Cloverdale, revitalizing an existing community rather than building one from scratch. At the same time, Esmeralda would offer something new: regular opportunities for residents to connect. Esmeralda speaks to a larger trend of millennials seeking more variety in where they live, whether they&#39;re leaving larger cities &mdash; or building their own. Esmeralda is the latest American experiment in intentional living Zuegel wants to build Esmeralda incrementally, inviting prospective town members to come together to share their visions and hopes for a new way of life. A key lesson she learned from Chautauqua&#39;s town archivist was its slow-growth model. The summer camp, founded in 1874 as a retreat for teachers, took time to grow into a full-fledged town. After several years of people pitching up tents, participants started to bring their families and upgraded to more permanent shacks. America has a long history of intentional communities, where like-minded individuals band together, believing they&#39;ve cracked the code for a better life. In most cases, the community grows organically, shaped by the people who join. In the 18th century, the Shakers, a Christian sect dedicated to pacifism and celibacy , established &#34;utopias&#34; throughout New England, emphasizing shared property. In the 19th century, the Transcendentalists, a philosophical movement, flocked to Brook Farm in Massachusetts , where famous writers Nathaniel Hawthorne and Margaret Fuller dabbled in &#34;plain living.&#34; Intentional communities surged in the 1960s and 1970s as counterculture movements fueled new communes of young people intent on &#34;dropping out&#34; of traditional society. Vermont , in particular, saw over 75 new communes, expert Yvonne Daley told Forbes , which changed the political spirit of the state. Today, an estimated 3,500 intentional communities dot the US, according to the nonprofit Foundation for Intentional Community, with a broad definition spanning student co-ops, eco-living communities, and religious groups. 2024 Edge Esmeralda attendees participated in a range of workshops and events. Edge Esmeralda To shape her new town, Zuegel launched Edge Esmeralda , a monthlong pop-up event designed to give attendees a taste of what the real Esmeralda could be. In 2024, the retreat hosted over 1,300 people through 25 different program tracks on topics like AI and longevity . Attendees, who could stay for a day, a week, or a whole month, enjoyed various activities such as building a solar-powered A-frame house, joining a &#34;neurotech&#34; workshop, a hackathon, or taking in an art exhibit. Zuegel plans to host another Edge Esmeralda in 2025. Canadian college student Anson Yu, who attended Edge Esmeralda as an energy fellow, told BI that the experience gave her hope that Zuegel&#39;s team could deliver on their vision. Days spent building the A-frame house, followed by nights of swing-dancing in the town square, made her feel like a special community was coming together. &#34;I felt like there could be spaces that exist like this, outside of the couple of city centers that already exist, and outside of college campuses,&#34; Yu said. A millennial shift in priorities Edge Esmeralda attendees represent many millennials who yearn for a greater sense of community. In many ways, a community like Esmerelda is a natural response from members of the &#34; job-hopping generation &#34; who pioneered remote work. What if that dream of flexible living could include a stronger sense of community? Edge Esmeralda attendees represent many millennials who yearn for a greater sense of community. Edge Esmeralda When millennials came into the workforce around the 2008 recession , we saw a shift in how young people viewed life and work, Dr. Katherine Loflin, a sociologist known as &#34; The City Doctor ,&#34; told Business Insider. Appetite for jobs in manufacturing and utilities &mdash; ones that required a worker to live nearby &mdash; declined significantly between 1990 and 2015 , according to the Pew Research Center. Meanwhile, demand for desk jobs swung up. Loflin, who studies the characteristics that draw people to different places, said job seekers told her they craved flexibility and work-life balance . They didn&#39;t want to follow the conveyor belt into an industry that could crumble at any minute. They were more interested in developing transferable &#34; soft skills &#34; that could lead to bigger salary jumps and the option of remote work. The pandemic turbocharged that trend: Suddenly, the fantasy of working from anywhere became a reality. But there was something missing. Big city life often felt lonely , with fewer opportunities to make easy connections, especially as work became more remote . Some missed campus life, when they could easily befriend people they saw in class or on the quad. The Stanford University campus. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images &#34;So many people refer to college as the best years of their lives,&#34; Zuegel said. Because of the more effortless sense of community, Loflin said campus-like towns &#34;harken back to a time where people felt alive, they felt in it together.&#34; The isolation of the pandemic prompted Zuegel to think about cities and the ways they create or restrict access to community. &#34;The pandemic kept people apart, but that actually showed us how much we need friends and family,&#34; she said. Beta-testing a community So far, some fellow tech workers are excited about Esmeralda and even see themselves living there . However, some online commenters have expressed skepticism toward Esmeralda, particularly concerning affordable housing , transportation , or if locals really want to share a home with wealthy VCs . Loflin said it&#39;s common for city developers to overly focus on aesthetics, forgetting to consider other logistics, like long-term community building or accessible infrastructure. Zuegel is aware of the issues that may come up, hence the slower timeline. &#34;A lot of real estate developers&#39; approach is they build it and then hope people will be a part of it,&#34; Zuegel said. &#34;We want to take a much more incremental and gradual path.&#34; She said the project is still in &#34;phase 0,&#34; with hopes of involving the local Cloverdale community as much as possible. Local residents are excited about the project, Cloverdale city manager Kevin Thompson told BI. For two decades, real estate developers have swept in and out of town with big ideas for the plot of land that Zuegel&#39;s team has contracted, only to burn out quickly. Thompson said no group in recent years has gone this far in the due diligence process as Esmeralda&#39;s, which gives the locals hope that progress is happening. &#34;There&#39;s been a lot of tire kickers over the years,&#34; Thompson said. &#34;We&#39;ve never gotten to this point of anyone actually submitting any paperwork to change it.&#34; Zuegel told BI that she wants Esmeralda to be a place where kids can safely roam outside on their own. Edge Esmeralda Zuegel said the exact logistics of Esmeralda are subject to change as she continues to learn from Edge Esmeralda. Her vision involves a pedestrian-friendly community, safe for young kids to play outside on their own, and accessible enough for older adults. She also wants a mix of locals and visitors, as full-time residents will be the soul of Esmeralda. Ultimately, the guiding light is for her to feel as she did in all her Chautauqua summers as a child. &#34;The idea is the culture from a big city, but with sort of the small town charm.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "In an era of quiet glow-ups, no-prep veneers are the new 'it' cosmetic procedure",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/no-prep-veneers-new-trend-in-cosmetic-dentistry-2025-4",
    "description": "&nbsp; Getty No-prep veneers are gaining popularity as a less invasive cosmetic dental option. Traditional veneers require tooth shaving, leading to long-term damage concerns. No-prep veneers can be costlier but align with the trend of subtle cosmetic enhancements. For decades, celebrities, influencers, and high-fliers have relied on a technique to give them perfect smiles: veneers . Or at least, they did. Demand for flawless teeth is still high. Getting your teeth shaved down irreversibly? Not so much. These days, &#34;no-prep veneers&#34; are rising up as the new &#34;it&#34; procedure. The result is similar to traditional veneers, but there&#39;s no filing, drilling, or grinding involved to make room for the porcelain shells. It&#39;s all part of the &#34;quiet glow-up&#34; trend. Forget Botox, people want microtox . Instead of face and neck lifts, cosmetic surgeons are fielding requests for biostimulators and skin boosters. Proponents include Bryan Johnson , famed longevity seeker, who has spoken about his decision to get no-prep veneers to improve the whiteness of his teeth without shaving them down. &#34;Many young people see videos of people sharing their shaved-down teeth, and they are being educated about the high risk&#34; of long-term damage , Dr. Lilya Horowitz, cosmetic and general dentist and owner of Domino Dental , told Business Insider. Horowitz says she has seen an uptick in people coming into her Brooklyn clinic for &#34;low-risk&#34; cosmetic tweaks like no-prep veneers to revamp broken, chipped, cracked, or discolored teeth. &#34;The more you know about the risks of cutting your teeth down, the more you will be motivated to seek more conservative options.&#34; No-prep veneers are not for everyone. People with larger teeth or more severely discolored teeth may fare better with traditional veneers. Plus, they&#39;re no cheaper &mdash; often more expensive. Still, in this era of subtle &#34; tweakments ,&#34; they&#39;re emerging as the go-to job in cosmetic dentistry. Skip the drilling Both traditional and no-prep veneers start the same way: after a good cleaning and polishing, your dentist gets 3D scans of your teeth, dental radiographs, and high-res photos to create a prototype of your veneers. If you&#39;re getting no-preps, the prototype will be placed on your teeth for an idea of the color, size, and new shape to ensure you&#39;re happy with the look. If you&#39;re getting traditional veneers, the dentist will drill down your teeth before placing the prototype to make sure they fit. The lab then starts the fabrication process for your custom porcelain veneers, which takes about two weeks. The material of choice for both is porcelain, but a much thinner porcelain is used for no-prep veneers. Once they&#39;re produced, the veneers are ready to be placed on your teeth for your final approval. There is a very specific sterilization protocol before the bonding process. That removes any plaque and bacteria before the veneers are bonded onto your teeth with a resin cement. How we fell out of love with traditional veneers The practice of covering up dental imperfections with porcelain veneers began in the early 1980s . A decade or so later, it went mainstream. &#34;I think we really started seeing them gain popularity, or in the very least the general public becoming more aware of them, in the late 1990s when many actors and actresses in Hollywood were opting for large, white, more obvious veneers,&#34; Los Angeles-based cosmetic dentist Dr. Jon Marashi , whose clients include Ryan Seacrest, Kate Hudson, and Ben Affleck, told BI. Dr. Jon Marashi, a cosmetic dentist to the stars, says demand is soaring for no-prep veneers Antar Hanif When veneers first emerged, the procedure was less invasive, since the material of choice &mdash; feldspathic porcelain &mdash; was very thin and could fit neatly on most teeth. Since the early 2000s, stronger materials have emerged that are better at covering up imperfections. These materials, such as zirconia or lithium disilicate, are now the standard. They&#39;re up to 50% thicker, making them less fragile and easier to work with for both veneers (covering the front of the tooth) and crowns (wrapping around the whole tooth). That thickness also requires more room. Dentists should only shave off, at most, 0.5mm per tooth, but the thick material can cover up imprecision. Some practitioners &#34;excessively drill a tooth down to a tiny nub&#34; to speed up the job, Marashi said. &#34;Unfortunately, over the years, there has been a tendency for the tooth to be excessively drilled, and I think that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing the pendulum shift toward the no-drill option.&#34; Teeth aren&#39;t like hair or skin; they won&#39;t just grow back, which makes the traditional veneers route more &#34;permanent.&#34; That&#39;s a bitter pill for Rebecca Bacon, a 32-year-old speech-language pathologist who got traditional veneers in 2009, when she was 16. In high school, she was self-conscious about two of her teeth that grew smaller than average. Eventually her parents and dentist agreed on a solution: her teeth were shaved down and covered with perfect porcelain shells. For a while, her new pearly whites were excellent. But cracks started to show &mdash; literally &mdash; no matter how carefully she chewed her food. &#34;My veneers aren&#39;t great,&#34; Bacon told BI. &#34;One has slipped and shows a sliver of tooth at the top and the other cracked and needed to be fixed. They were supposed to last 20 years! I hate that I still can&#39;t bite into apples.&#34; She wonders if this would be easier to fix if she&#39;d had the option of no-preps. Patients are gravitating toward no-prep for their smile makeovers In a way, no-preps are like retro veneers, using the same feldspathic porcelain as they did in the 80s. No-prep veneers by Domino Dental in New York City Domino Dental The difference? A little more finesse because today&#39;s dentists have been doing veneers since they started and the practice come on leaps and bounds. If you&#39;re deciding between the two, the first stage is to discuss your ultimate goals with your dental professional for a clear understanding of how you want to improve your smile. With no-preps, &#34;the original tooth remains entirely intact,&#34; Marashi said. That means your teeth should be good for the long haul. &#34;If you decide to remove veneers later on, a laser can be used to remove the veneers and return the tooth to its original state.&#34; However, your dentist will determine whether no-prep veneers are an option for you. You may want to rethink no-prep if your goal is to significantly alter the color of your teeth . &#34;Patients with discolored front teeth that want a dramatic color change would also not be good candidate for this since no-prep veneers are very thin,&#34; Horowitz said. &#34;Traditional veneers are able to hide more imperfections in teeth.&#34; Plus, if you have excessively crowded or large teeth, you will probably need a bit of drilling. The deciding factor is how far out past the lip your teeth are. &#34;Usually, if teeth are behind the wet/dry border of your lower lip, there is some room to build out. Building teeth out past that border is not recommended,&#34; Horowitz added. Dr. Lilya Horowitz at Domino Dental sees a lot of people who want perfect teeth without all the drilling Domino Dental No-prep does not necessarily mean a discounted price &mdash; some dental practices charge upwards of $3,500 per tooth for no-preps, which is more than some charge for traditional veneers. &#34;The reason for this is the sensitivity of the technique,&#34; Horowitz said. &#34;It takes a lot more skills to remove very little or no tooth structure and create a beautiful result instead of drilling down the teeth and having a lot of room to work with.&#34; Traditional veneers, on the other hand, can be faster because &#34;it does not require as much time to over-drill a tooth compared to a delicate and conservative tooth preparation,&#34; Marashi said. Take care of your pearly whites! Keep in mind that, while veneers are made to last, the length of their lifespan fully depends on the skillset and execution of the dentist who applies them and post-treatment patient care. &#34;General studies have shown a 95% survival rate of porcelain veneers over a 10-year period,&#34; Horowitz said. &#34;If well taken care of and bonded well to enamel, they can last multiple decades.&#34; As long as your veneers are properly bonded, there should be no risk of plaque build-up or bacteria leakage beneath them, either. Still, all veneers &mdash; like teeth &mdash; need TLC. That means brushing, flossing, and keeping up with regular cleanings as you always did with your teeth.

    "description": "Bill Gates is reflecting on 50 years of Microsoft. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Bill Gates is taking a look back at the code that started it all. The Microsoft cofounder this week published the code that became the first product of the company. Take a look at Microsoft&#39;s origins as the company turns 50 this month. Microsoft is turning 50 this year, and Bill Gates is looking back at how the company got its start. The Microsoft cofounder published a blog post on Wednesday about the code that would become the company&#39;s first product, which was the Altair Basic, an interpreter that translated code into instructions that the Altair 8800 microcomputer could read. &#34;That code remains the coolest code I&#39;ve ever written to this day,&#34; Gates wrote. &#34;It&#39;s amazing to think about how this one piece of code led to a half-century of innovation from Microsoft. Before there was Office or Windows 95 or Xbox or AI, there was the original source code &mdash; and I still get a kick out of seeing it, even all these years later.&#34; At the end of his post, he included a PDF of the original source code for the Altair Basic &mdash; all 157 pages of it. You can check it out here . In his blog post, Gates noted that late Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen finished part of the code on a flight to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Microsoft was originally based. Gates shared other details on the source code, fittingly, in his memoir &#34;Source Code,&#34; which came out in February. Gates reflected on his childhood through his career into today in the book. He wrote that he was disinterested in school growing up, noting that his preschool teachers called him &#34;rebellious&#34; and said he showed a &#34;complete lack of concern for any phase of school life.&#34; Gates also wrote about his approach, decades later, to recruiting Steve Ballmer to Microsoft , saying he and Allen had agreed to a split of 64% and 36%, respectively, but Gates ended up giving a 4% stake to Ballmer to convince him to quit business school for Microsoft. Gates&#39; ex-wife, Melinda French Gates , has her own memoir, &#34;The Next Day,&#34; out later this month. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "What Bill Gates says he got 'wrong' and was 'pretty naive' about in Microsoft's early days",

    "description": "John Nacion/Getty Images Bill Gates cofounded Microsoft 50 years ago and in hindsight, he&#39;d do some things differently. He said in a recent podcast that he &#34;turned out to be wrong&#34; about some elements of building teams. He also said he was &#34;pretty naive&#34; when it came to politics. Happy birthday to Microsoft . The tech behemoth turns 50 this month. While it has revolutionized personal computing and become one of the world&#39;s biggest companies today , there are some things one of its leaders might&#39;ve done differently if he could turn back time. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates recently talked about the advice he&#39;d give his younger self on a podcast featuring the three CEOs who&#39;ve led Microsoft in the company&#39;s 50-year history: himself, his successor Steve Ballmer , and now Satya Nadella . &#34;Well, there was a lot of learning about how to grow the company and bring in different skill sets, how to manage people,&#34; he said . &#34;I certainly at first thought that engineering skill meant you would be good at other things. That turned out to be wrong. So we had to really build teams in a more mixed, diverse set of skills than I expected.&#34; Gates also said he&#39;d have advised his younger self to be more politically savvy. &#34;You know, I might tell my younger self, watch out for the government,&#34; he said. &#34;I might have a little bit of a tussle with them. I didn&#39;t anticipate that. I was pretty naive about not engaging in Washington, DC, as soon as I should have.&#34; Microsoft was the subject of a massive antitrust case in the 1990s brought by the US Department of Justice and several states, which alleged Microsoft was becoming a monopoly. In 2000, a judge found that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws, and Microsoft was ordered to split into two companies. An appeals court later tossed the judge&#39;s order, and the Justice Department gave up its effort to split up Microsoft. The DOJ and Microsoft settled in 2001. Gates has mulled advice to his younger self before. He periodically does &#34;Ask Me Anything&#34; sessions on Reddit, and in 2017, one user asked him, &#34;If you could give 19-year-old Bill Gates some advice, what would it be?&#34; Gates answered: &#34;I would explain that smartness is not single-dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then. I would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. I wasn&#39;t very good socially back then, but I am not sure there is advice that would fix that &mdash; maybe I had to be awkward and just grow up.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "I spent 3 nights in a secluded lodge in Italy's Dolomites. The views were unreal, but they weren't even the best part.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/forestis-dolomites-italy-hotel-review",
    "description": "The view from the reporter&#39;s suite at Forestis. Monica Humphries/Business Insider Forestis is a five-star hotel tucked in Italy&#39;s Dolomites. The property connects guests with nature through saunas, locally sourced meals, and stunning views. I spent three nights at the hotel where luxury was around every corner. The morning sun slowly crept up, illuminating the outline of the Dolomites . I squinted out my hotel suite&#39;s floor-to-ceiling windows in disbelief. &#34;They can&#39;t be that close,&#34; I murmured out loud, fearing I&#39;d wake my friend sleeping near me. It was still largely dark outside, and I begged the sun to rise faster. Ages later (realistically just 20 minutes), light illuminated each jagged peak. The mountains were, in fact, that close. This time, I didn&#39;t think twice about waking my friend. In our PJs, we hurried onto our balcony at Forestis to get a little closer to the range. As we sipped coffee and admired the striking views, we feared the morning was setting an unrealistic standard for the rest of our stay. Shockingly, the views weren&#39;t even the best part of Forestis. Forestis is tucked in Italy&#39;s Dolomites mountain range. The Dolomites from the reporter&#39;s balcony. Monica Humphries/Business Insider The five-star hotel sits 5,905 meters above sea level near the Italian town of Brixen. In 1912, the property was originally planned to be a sanatorium built by the Austrian monarchy. The area&#39;s fresh spring water, mountain air, and nature were thought to provide an ideal environment for healing. Construction started, but the plans were never finished as war sprung across the region. In 2000, hotelier Alois Hinteregger discovered the abandoned building , which his family purchased and opened as a hotel in 2010. A decade later, Alois&#39; son Stefan and his partner, Teresa Unterthiner, expanded the property and transformed it into the five-star retreat it is today. Three towers of suites and a private villa complete the resort. A view of one of the property&#39;s three towers. Monica Humphries/Business Insider My friend and I arrived at the property at night. We drove up the winding Plose Mountain, and the lights from the nearby town slowly disappeared. Even at night, it was clear that Forestis was a grand property. Three towers stretch toward the sky, home to 40 suites and two penthouses. Adjoining the towers is a historic building with suites, hotel rooms, a restaurant, a bar, and a spa. While the sanatorium never operated as planned, one completed building did serve as a doctor&#39;s residence in the early 20th century. That building has been remodeled and restored to a private villa with a spa and garden for 10 guests. Rates at the five-star property start at $865, depending on the time of year, and include breakfast for two. Business Insider received a media rate for the three-night stay. Piney references are across the entire property. A view of the property. Monica Humphries/Business Insider From rooms with spruce-paneled walls to a spa using mountain pine and Swiss stone pine scents, Forestis is consistent in its theme. The resort&#39;s goal is to connect guests with the four elements, and for three days, it was impossible to forget I was surrounded by nature. Suites feature floor-to-ceiling glass windows that frame the mountains. Meanwhile, each suite&#39;s walls, floors, and ceiling are paneled in spruce. The reporter&#39;s tower suite. Monica Humphries/Business Insider As I stepped into my tower suite, the forest theme continued. Every inch of the room was covered in spruce wood, besides one wall dedicated to glass windows. A king-sized bed filled one corner facing the suite&#39;s floor-to-ceiling windows, and across the room was an L-shaped seating area. At the front of the room was a balcony with a daybed big enough for two. Toward the entrance to the room was a large closet area and a stone-inspired bathroom with a double vanity, shower, and tub. Here, rock had been ground into plaster and covered the bathroom walls &mdash; an element I spotted across the resort. One cabinet held complimentary drinks and snacks; a new treat, such as truffles and chocolates, arrived just before bedtime each evening. The room&#39;s design was simple &mdash; there was no artwork or decor. Couch cushions and bed sheets were in grays and whites, and it seemed like all focus was directed toward the nearby Dolomites. While it was hard to leave the breathtaking room, the resort&#39;s highlight was the spa and pool. The indoor and outdoor pools. Monica Humphries/Business Insider After waking up to the striking mountain views, my friend and I considered never leaving the suite. We could call room service when hungry and spend the day admiring the mountains. It was tempting, but we headed downstairs to explore the spa. While we considered never leaving the suite, exiting the spa was even more challenging. At the heart of the 21,500-square-foot spa was the most impressive pool I&#39;ve ever seen. Unsurprisingly, the pool had views of the Dolomites. Half of it was indoors, and the other was outdoors. Guests could swim between the two through sliding glass doors. The area also had loungers, daybeds, a water station with small snacks, a sauna, and a steam room. A hallway led to another wing of the spa, which had two more indoor saunas, one at 185 degrees Fahrenheit and another at 158 degrees. There was a cold plunge, a silent room with a fireplace, and a tea lounge. A door led outdoors to the fifth sauna, which was tucked inside a traditional South Tyrolean wooden house, and a second outdoor cold plunge. While access to these amenities is included in the stay, the property&#39;s spa also offers treatments like massages, facials, scrubs, and manicures. Here, guests discover the magic of saunas and cold plunging. Side-by-side images of the cold plunge and sauna. Monica Humphries/Business Insider Beyond spa offerings, Forestis has a daily calendar of activities for guests. My friend and I debated between meditation sessions and guided hikes. Ultimately, we decided to join the daily complimentary sauna ritual. Celtic practices inspire Forestis&#39; spa, and perhaps this one encapsulated that the most. Saro, a member of the spa team, led the ritual. We stepped inside the hot sauna with two other guests. As steam rose from the rocks, Saro turned on powerful instrumental music, flicked open a large fan, and danced for the next 15 minutes. New essential oils were thrown onto the rocks every five minutes, enveloping the sauna in a new (typically pine) scent. We focused on breathing as we were hit with waves of heat. Meditating through the hot air was relaxing, incredibly challenging, and rewarding. As Saro wrapped up the ritual, he encouraged us all to cold plunge. We felt both energized and relaxed, and after that, my friend and I were hooked. Each night, a seven-course dinner was served. Side-by-side dishes at Forestis. Monica Humphries/Business Insider A luxury resort wouldn&#39;t be complete without fine dining, and that&#39;s exactly what we discovered at Forestis. The restaurant served three menus each evening: a seven-course Forestis menu, a seven-course detox menu, and an à la carte menu. The menus change each day, and, of course, the dishes are inspired by the forest and local ingredients. We dined on salads with South Tyrolean apples, vegan ravioli with fennel, gnocchi and herbs, duck breast, and an impressive array of desserts. The dinner costs $140 and can be added to your stay. In the morning, I indulged in the most extravagant breakfast buffet I&#39;ve ever seen. The restaurant at Forestis. Monica Humphries/Business Insider My friend and I spent an afternoon with pastry chef Irene, where we saw what local ingredients were being incorporated into the morning pastries and evening desserts. We infused the flavor of local hay in white chocolate syrup and made kipfel cookies. The next morning, Irene&#39;s creations were on display in the most extravagant breakfast buffet I&#39;ve ever seen. I eyed eight different pastries, including gluten-free and dairy-free options. There were more than five freshly baked breads, five milk choices, five cheeses, seven types of smoked fish and cured meats, five types of butter, yogurt, fruits, cereal, and an entire room dedicated to fresh juice. Beyond that, there was a breakfast menu where I eyed hot dishes. Again, it was tempting to never leave. Outside, Forestis has direct access to ski slopes and summer hiking. The reporter&#39;s friend heads out to ski. Monica Humphries/Business Insider The property offers guided hikes and access to four bike routes. A little chilly for hiking, my friend and I spent our mornings skiing on Plose Mountain. The inconveniences of skiing &mdash; traffic, long walks to the chair lift, and lugging gear &mdash; disappeared. Forestis has ski-in, ski-out access, along with a ski room to store gear. My three nights at Forestis were a modern escape in nature &mdash; and I&#39;m unsure I&#39;ll find a spa that can ever compare. The reporter at Forestis. Monica Humphries/Business Insider The stay at Forestis flashed by, but the property left a lasting impression. In three days, I skied new mountains, soaked in stunning pools, and fell even more in love with Italy and the Dolomites. And I still haven&#39;t forgotten the spa. A few weeks after returning home to Denver, my friend and I searched for nearby saunas &mdash; itching to recreate any semblance of Forestis&#39; spa experience.
