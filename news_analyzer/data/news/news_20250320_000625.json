    "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+ and Hulu, Audible, Max and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it (eventually? maybe?) drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This Amazon Spring Sale deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. The deal runs through April 30. Paramount+ student discount - 50 percent off any plan: Ahead of March Madness , students can get half off any Paramount+ plan through April 8. To get the discount, scroll to the bottom of the Paramount+ homepage and click &quot;Get a 50% discount&quot; next to &quot;Are you a student?&quot; CBS shares broadcast rights with Warner Bros. Discovery this year for the men&#39;s tournament, so you&#39;ll be able to catch games on Paramount+ if you have the subscription tier that includes Showtime. Starz (six months) for $18 ($28 off): Starz&#39;s latest offer gives you six months of access for only $18, which shakes out to about $3 per month. This represents a 61-percent discount off the standard &quot;semi-annual&quot; plan, which puts six months of access up for $46. To get the offer, go to the Starz website and click on &quot;claim special offer.&quot; You&#39;ll have to provide your email address before the discounted rates appear. As an alternative, you could opt for the monthly plan discount, which is currently $3 per month for a total of three months. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Fubo Essential for $50/month for the first month ($35 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Sling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you&#39;ll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you&#39;ll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange &amp; Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month : This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

    "description": "There is something so incredibly frustrating about typing on a digital keyboard with a controller. Whether for streaming or gaming, the slowness with which you often have to find each letter is just painful. Well, thankfully, there&#39;s an improvement on the way for Xbox controllers , with Microsoft announcing a new gamepad keyboard for Windows 11&#39;s touch keyboard.&nbsp; Microsoft The updated keyboard should make it easier to use the on-screen one with an Xbox controller. It brings greater navigation to the controller and helpful shortcuts. For example, the X button can function as backspace, the Y button as the spacebar and the menu button as enter. Microsoft also states that it has vertically aligned the keyboard keys for smoother use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft first shared that it was beta testing this technology back in September . Now, it&#39;s available in the Release Preview version of Windows 11, so you should be able to try it out for yourself within the next few weeks. Hopefully it saves you a lot of time and frustration (and that streamers will come up with their own solutions soon).&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-launches-a-new-gamepad-keyboard-layout-for-windows-11-154011591.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Although the Amazon Spring Sale doesn&#39;t start in earnest until next week, there are a bunch of early deals to be had. Among them is an offer that sees Google&#39;s Pixel Buds Pro 2 drop to a record low price. The earbuds are currently $179, which is $50 (or 22 percent) off. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are our pick for the best wireless earbuds for Google phones . For one thing, they fit more comfortably and securely after a redesign made them smaller than the Pixel Buds Pro. Improvements to audio quality helped the Pixel Buds Pro 2 obtain a score of 88 in our review . Revisions to the acoustics and drivers — as well as the inclusion of a Tensor chip to take care of active noise cancellation (ANC) and audio signal processing — help the earbuds deliver ample, punchy bass, as well as full mids and crisp highs. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 offer up to eight hours of use on a single charge with ANC enabled. When you factor in the charging case, you&#39;ll get up to 30 hours of total listening time when ANC is on. The earbuds have an IP54 rating, indicating that they&#39;re protected from dust and water splashes. In terms of features, the earbuds include hands-free access to the Gemini voice assistant. Spatial audio is available, albeit only for certain video streaming apps for now. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 offer automatic switching between devices that are linked to your Google account. Other features include conversation detection, a hearing wellness tool and Find My Device.

    "description": "Google’s Nest Learning Thermostat is on sale for $240 right now, as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s close to a record low price for the 4th-gen device that was released just last year . This deal is available for multiple colorways, including silver, gold and black. This is a modern thermostat, so that means AI. The device offers suggestions on how to lower energy usage and can automatically adjust settings in the home based on factors like ambient temperature and daily schedules. It ships with a wireless temperature sensor for accurate measurements. This sensor can run for three years before needing a new battery. This model can accommodate six of these sensors, for large properties, but that requires some additional purchases. A three-pack of the sensors typically costs $100.&nbsp; The Nest Learning Thermostat is more customizable than its predecessors, with the ability to select from several smartwatch-style faces. It’s also much larger than previous models and includes Soli radar sensors to determine how close a person is. The display will adjust accordingly, with an increased font size when standing far away and vice versa. The installation is fairly simple, but will still require some light wiring. The only real bad thing to say about this thermostat is that $280 is a whole lot of money. That concern is mostly alleviated by today’s sale.

The latter includes a six percent discount on Apple&#39;s new 11-inch iPad .&nbsp; The 128GB 2025 model is down to $329 from $349 in every color. It comes with an A16 chip that gives it a performance boost, though not enough power for Apple Intelligence like the iPad Air with an M3 chip . It also offers features such as a 12MP wide camera, 4K video and a liquid retina display.&nbsp; If you&#39;re not fussed about getting the newest model then check out Amazon&#39;s sale on Apple&#39;s 10th generation iPad . Right now, it&#39;s down to $269 from $349 — a 23 percent discount.

    "description": "Despite streaming services continuing to dominate the business of recorded music, there’s still very much a place for physical media in that sector. The Recording Industry of America said in an annual report [ PDF ] that sales of vinyl records rose for the 18th straight year in the US to $1.4 billion — the highest revenue for that format since 1984, when CDs started to emerge. Vinyl accounted for nearly three-quarters of physical format revenue in 2024. It was the third consecutive year that there were more shipments of vinyl records than CDs — 44 million vs. 33 million. It perhaps helps vinyl’s case that the RIAA has factored in sales figures directly from indie labels for the first time this year. And that Taylor Swift released thirty-six variants of her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department , including eight vinyl editions.&nbsp; Many fans prefer to own physical copies of music for many reasons, such as their belief that vinyl offers better audio quality and an all-round superior listening experience to streaming services, as well as a way to perhaps better support artists . Scouring the racks at a record store is a fun pastime as well. Vinyl records and CDs are also a hedge against the possibility of music vanishing from streaming services if rights agreements expire or an artist decides to yank their music from a platform. Still, streaming services hit a new milestone last year. The RIAA reports that the average number of paid subscriptions for the year hit 100 million in the US for the first time. That’s a three percent increase from 2023. Revenue from paid subscriptions rose by five percent to $11.7 billion, with the total revenue from streaming (factoring everything from ad-supported services to fitness apps) growing four percent to $14.9 billion. Streaming accounted for 84 percent of recorded music revenue for the third year running.

    "description": "You can save on some of our top picks for the best security cameras as part of a sale on Blink gear thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . For instance, the Blink Mini 2 is available for $20 , which is half off the list price. It matches a record low. A two-pack of the Blink Mini 2 is down to $38 as well. That&#39;s not quite a record low, but you&#39;ll still save $22 due to the 46 percent percent discount. We reckon the Blink Mini 2 is the best budget security camera around. You can adjust the webcam-style camera to a variety of angles. It&#39;s weather-resistant, so you can place it outside if you have a special power adapter. The camera picks up decent (but not great) images, particularly those captured in the infrared nighttime view. It also has a built-in LED spotlight. Since Blink is an Amazon company, of course the Mini 2 ties into the Alexa ecosystem. You&#39;ll just need to have a Blink account before you can actually use it. As you might expect, you&#39;ll be able to view images captured by the Mini 2 via the Alexa app on an Echo Show, Fire Tablet or Fire TV but, curiously, not iOS or Android. To see the captures on your phone or tablet, you&#39;ll instead need to use the Blink app. You&#39;ll get some extra features — such as cloud storage and people and pet detection — if you sign up for the Blink Subscription ($3 per month for one camera, $10 per month for any number). Elsewhere in the sale, a five-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras is half off at $200 . This is our recommendation for the best security camera for Alexa users . Having five of them should be enough for many folks to keep an eye on everything that&#39;s going on around their property.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/heres-how-the-pixel-9a-compares-to-the-competition-141043690.html?src=rss",
    "description": "After a mountain of leaks, Google has finally announced the Pixel 9a . There&#39;s a good chance you clicked on this article to find out how the 9a compares to its predecessor . The good news is you came to the right place. Even better, it&#39;s a favorable comparison.&nbsp; Pixel 9a vs Pixel 8a&nbsp; For starters, the Pixel 9a features a new design. Instead of borrowing the design language of Google&#39;s more expensive devices, the new phone has its own identity. Gone is the divisive camera bar that has defined recent Pixel phones. Instead, the main camera module is nearly flush with the rear of the phone. Additionally, the new handset offers slightly better ingress protection. It&#39;s IP68-certified against water and dust, up from IP67 on the 8a. The Pixel 9a will also be available two lovely new colors: Iris and Peony. Sadly, Google won&#39;t offer an Aloe colorway this time around, at least not at release.&nbsp; Outside of those changes, the 9a sports a larger 6.3 display. Like with the 8a, Google has gone with a FHD panel, meaning the 9a&#39;s screen is slightly less dense due to it being a bit larger overall. However, it&#39;s the better display. The 9a&#39;s pOLED panel is capable of reaching a peak brightness of 2,700 nits, up from 2,000 nits on the 8a. It&#39;s also HDR10+ certified, with a 120Hz refresh rate. That additional brightness will make it easier to see the 9a&#39;s screen in bright sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internally, the 9a features Google&#39;s latest Tensor G4 SoC, paired once again with 8GB of RAM. Google has also outfitted the 9a with a larger 5,100mAh battery, up from 4,492mAh on the 8a. Just as importantly, the 9a is capable of charging at a faster 23W. That&#39;s still slow compared to a device like the Nothing 3a Pro, which is compatible with 50W power adapters, but an improvement over the 8a&#39;s glacial 18W. Oh, and if you were hoping for Qi2 support , I&#39;m sorry to say the 9a is limited to charging at 7.5W wirelessly.&nbsp; As for cameras, Google hasn&#39;t changed its winning formula. The 9a features a 48MP main camera with f/1.7 lens and optical image stabilization (OIS). On paper, that might seem like a downgrade from the 8a&#39;s 64MP main sensor, but they both feature a 0.8µm pixel pitch, meaning they&#39;re capable of capturing the same amount of light, and it appears Google sourced a newer sensor for the 9a. Otherwise, the Pixel 9a appears to feature the same ultrawide and selfie cameras as its predecessor. As always, when you buy a Pixel phone, you&#39;re buying it for Google&#39;s computational photography features, and you get all the usual standouts like Night Sight, Best Take and more.&nbsp; Pixel 9a vs iPhone 16e and Nothing 3a Pro The iPhone 16e continues to confound since its announcement in February. At $599, it&#39;s a full $100 more expensive than the Pixel 9a, and comparing the two based on hardware alone, Google&#39;s new midrange phone is the better deal. You get a significantly bigger battery, a 120Hz display and an entire extra camera. Of course, whether you should buy the 9a over the 16e will entirely depend on your preference for Android over iOS. If you like prefer Apple&#39;s software, the Pixel 9a won&#39;t do it for you.&nbsp; The more interesting comparison is between the 9a and Nothing&#39;s new Phone 3a Pro . For $40 less, you get an even bigger screen, a more original design and, most notably, a periscope camera that offers 3x optical zoom. A great telephoto is really hard to find at this price range, so the 3a Pro might be worth considering for that reason alone. The tradeoff is Google&#39;s software support is unmatched, and 3a Pro comes with a limited warranty in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pixel 9a Pixel 8a iPhone 16e Nothing 3a Pro Price $499/$559 $499/$559 $599 / $699 / $899 $459 Dimensions 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9 mm (6.09 x 2.89 x 0.35 inches) 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9 mm (6 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches) 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8 mm (5.78 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches) 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.9 mm (6.44 x 3.05 x 0.33 inches) Weight 186g (6.56 ounces) 188g (6.7 ounces) 167g (5.88 ounces) 211g (7.44 ounces) Screen size 6.3 inches 6.1 inches 6.1 inches 6.77 inches Screen resolution 1080 x 2,424 pixels (421ppi) 1,080 x 2,400 pixels (430ppi) 1,170 x 2,532 pixels (460 ppi) 1,080 x 2,392 pixels (387ppi) Screen type pOLED pOLED OLED AMOLED SoC Tensor G4 Tensor G3 Apple A18 Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 RAM 8GB 8GB 8GB 12GB Battery 5,100mAh 4,492mAh 4,005mAh 5,000mAh Storage 128 / 256 GB 128 / 256 GB 128 / 256 / 512 GB 256 GB Rear cameras Wide: 48MP, f/1.7 Ultrawide: 13MP, f/2.2 Wide: 64MP, f/1.89 Ultrawide: 13MP, f/2.2 Wide: 48MP, f/1.6 Wide: 50MP, f1/1.9 Ultrawide: 8MP, f/2.2 Periscope telephoto: 50MP, f/2.6 Front camera 13MP, f/2.2 13MP, f/2.2 12MP, f/1.9 50MP, f/2.2 Water / dust rating IP68 IP67 IP68 IP64 Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth v6.0 v5.3 v5.3 v5.4 OS Android 15 Android 15 iOS 18 Android 15 / Nothing OS 3.1 Colors Obsidian / Porcelain / Iris / Peony Obsidian / Porcelain / Aloe / Bay Black / White Black / Gray This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/heres-how-the-pixel-9a-compares-to-the-competition-141043690.html?src=rss",

    "description": "If you can&#39;t open a window for whatever reason, an air purifier can help make the air in your home a bit more comfortable. One of our favorites, the Levoit Core 400S air purifier , is on sale for $187 thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . While that&#39;s not a record low — we&#39;ve seen it as low as $177 last year — it&#39;s still a good discount on one of the most convenient air purifiers for large spaces. We’ve featured Levoit in our list of the best air purifiers for its strong performance and smart features. The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to. One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands. Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness. If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.

    "description": "Gone are the days of kids asking their parent to borrow cash or their card when going out with friends. Instead, parents can now give their kids access to Google Wallet for making in-store payments with their Android device. Google first announced that this feature was coming back in October.&nbsp; Kids can also use Google Wallet to store passes to things, including a library card, ticket for an event or a gift card. But, parents have a lot of oversight, such as receiving an email every time their child makes a purchase. They can also monitor everything within Family Link, along with remove a payment card or shut off access to all passes.&nbsp; Google Right now, Google is just rolling out the new feature for families in the US, UK, Australia, Spain and Poland. Parents in any of these locations should see the option pop up within the next few weeks.&nbsp; Apple users can already access a similar feature with Apple Cash Family . Parents can set up anyone in their Family Sharing group and let them make purchases, or send and receive money through their wallet or messages. Just like on Android, parents can see their kids&#39; purchases and get notifications each time they buy something. Plus, parents can view the remaining balance or send an allowance through Apple Cash by creating a recurring payment.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-wallet-is-now-available-for-kids-140039676.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Google has followed up an ocean&#39;s worth of leaks with the official announcement of its Pixel 9a smartphone, which will retail for $499. Possibly the biggest change to the new A-series model is in its appearance, with the removal of the camera bar on the back of the phone. In the 9a, the camera housing is &quot;slightly domed,&quot; sitting nearly flush with the rest of the frame, giving this midrange model a sleeker appearance. There are also new colors for this series — a pale purple dubbed Iris and a vibrant pink named Peony — joining the usual Porcelain and Obsidian options. (The peony option is similar to that on the pricier Pixel 9 .) The Pixel 9a is also getting a chip upgrade, moving up to Google&#39;s Tensor G4 processor from the G3 that was in Google&#39;s excellent Pixel 8a . Performance in the 8a was already quite good, so expect even smoother control with the G4. As with the 8a, the 9a is equipped with 8GB of RAM and comes with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. The new A-series also promises up to &quot;30+ hour battery life.&quot; Cameras were a big reason why we liked the Pixel 8a, naming it our top pick for a midrange smartphone . The housing is different in the 9a, but it&#39;s also got slightly different specs inside. The rear dual cameras in the 9a offer 48MP wide and 13MP ultrawide lenses, while the front is equipped with a 13MP selfie camera; the 8a had 64MP wide in the rear camera. It&#39;ll support AI-powered features such as Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Best Take and Photo Unblur. Google is bringing the Macro Focus option to the A-series for the first time for photos with lots of close-up details. There&#39;s also Night Sight to help improve your nocturnal photography.&nbsp; The 9a will be available in the US and Canada in North America, as well as numerous other countries in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Pre-orders will open in April, with no further detail on availability.

    "description": "A couple of weeks ago, Apple released a more affordable take on its flagship handsets with the iPhone 16e. But now Google is hitting back with the Pixel 9a and from what I&#39;ve seen, it looks like a way better deal. From the front, the 9a looks a lot like the standard Pixel 9 . Its screen is the same size at 6.3 inches across, while also offering a 120Hz refresh rate and a surprisingly strong 2,700 nits of peak brightness. On the inside, the 9a packs a Tensor G4 chip, just like you get on its more expensive siblings, along with other handy features including an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and Google’s standard seven years of OS updates, feature drops and security patches. But Google did something a bit surprising by giving the 9a a 5,100mAh battery, which is technically the biggest power pack in any member of the Pixel 9 family. That includes the Pixel 9 Pro XL (5,060mAh), though only by just a tiny bit. Regardless, Google says this gives the 9a the best longevity of any Pixel on sale today. If you flip the phone around, there are some other changes such as a new iris purple hue, which joins the existing peony, porcelain and obsidian color options. But the thing that jumps out the most is the lack of a camera bar, which has been present on practically all of Google’s phones dating back to the Pixel 6 . Instead, you get a simple window that sits almost flush against the back of the device — a window which Google says was inspired by the shape of a water drop. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Unfortunately, you don’t get a dedicated optical zoom (though it does support up to 8x digital SuperRes zoom). There is a 48MP main sensor that is similar, but slightly different to the one used on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and a 13MP sensor for its ultra-wide cam. The 9a also includes a built-in AI macro focus feature so you can get really close to things, on top of support for tons of Pixel-specific camera tools like Add Me, Best Take, Magic Editor and more. Notably, because it&#39;s powered by the Tensor G4, the 9a has access to all of the same AI features available on the rest of the Pixel 9 line. This includes Gemini Live Video, the Pixel Recorder app, and Pixel Studio not to mention security and safety offerings like Google VPN, car crash detection and so on. Sadly, I only had a brief time with the phone so we weren&#39;t able to test out many of its new features. Google seems to be feeling pretty confident about this phone, with the company saying that it will have the best cameras on any handset under $500. That&#39;s a pretty big claim, but it’s not entirely outlandish as Google&#39;s camera processing has been top-notch for quite some time. And with a starting price of $499, the Pixel 9a is skating in right under that line. So what&#39;s the catch — all this for $300 less than a regular Pixel 9? From what I&#39;ve seen so far, the biggest differences between the standard Pixel 9 and the 9a are that Google hasn&#39;t improved the latter&#39;s 23-watt wired or 7.5-watt wireless charging speeds, both of which are rather slow compared to a full-priced flagship. You also get less RAM, with the 9a featuring 8GB instead of 12GB. And while the 9a has Gorilla Glass covering its screen in front, around back there&#39;s a plastic panel made from around 85 percent recycled materials. But again, for three Benjamins less than the standard model, those are compromises I&#39;m mostly willing to put up with. The Google Pixel 9a will be available sometime in April starting at $499 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (the 256GB model is an optional upgrade). Purchases include free three-month subscriptions for Google One and YouTube Premium along with a six-month trial for Fitbit Premium.

    "description": "As was the case last year, Amazon will have another big sale to usher in spring for 2025. The Amazon Spring Sale is officially on the books, taking place from March 25 through March 31. The online retail giant is billing this as a good way for folks to stock up on end-of-season winter items, and save on all things fashion, beauty and household and outdoor gear. If last year was any indication, the Amazon Spring Sale won&#39;t be as much of a boon for tech deals as, say, Prime Day in July. However, there are always a number of decent deals that pop up on wireless earbuds, tablets and more. Considering the spring nature of the sale, we expect to see discounts on robot and cordless vacuums, household tech like air purifiers and even some smart home gear. With that in mind, here are the best early Amazon Spring Sale deals you can shop right now. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals so far Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you prefer desktops, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Apple AirTags (four-pack) for $70 ($29 off): These are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra wideband features for locating your things when they’re close by. Just attach them to your keys, wallet or bag with the right AirTag holder and keep track of everything in the Find My app. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Apple Watch Series 10 for $329 ($70 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $199 ($50 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $798 ($152 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $159 (42 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "description": "There’s now an industry-wide union for video game workers in the US and Canada. The United Videogame Workers-CWA (UVW-CWA) has a mission to bring together &quot;artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, freelancers and beyond to build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status.&quot; The union makes its official debut at the &quot;Video Game Labor at a Crossroads: New Pathways to Industry-Wide Organizing&quot; panel at GDC. Workers will be sharing a petition at the event to gain support for the union and to shine a light on the recent glut of industry layoffs . As a matter of fact, the first major issue the union seeks to address is layoffs, given that one in ten developers were shown the door in 2024. UVW-CWA Workers will also be passing around a zine that includes the organization’s mission statement, FAQs and an op-ed. This is a direct-join union, meaning that workers can sign up on their own. This allows folks to bypass traditional unionization processes like elections and employer consent. We aren’t sure if this will catch on throughout the industry or if major publishers will recognize the union. However, it’s just the latest salvo in the ongoing battle between industry workers and corporate bigwigs. Over 600 QA workers at Activision, which is owned by Microsoft, recently joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA.) ZeniMax Online Studios workers formed their own union at the tail-end of last year and Sega of America workers did something similar . These unions have also been busy. The CWA has been embroiled in a fight with Microsoft and Activision over unfair labor practices on behalf of workers at Raven Software. Members of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA also went on a one-day strike last year to limit Microsoft’s use of outsourcing.

    "description": "While Tesla is a popular car for ride-hailing drivers employed by the likes of Uber and more, the company could soon cut out the middleman. The California Public Utilities Commission has approved the company&#39;s bid for a transportation charter-party carrier permit, Bloomberg reports . The permit opens the way for Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber, Lyft and other established companies. Tesla employees would drive the cars, initially transporting fellow employees, before becoming available to the public. Last year, Elon Musk told investors that the company was already testing app-based transportation for Bay Area employees using safety drivers. Notably, Tesla is still not approved to use autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing, though Musk has claimed they will be available in Austin, Texas by June and in California by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Uber and Waymo launched their robotaxi service in Austin earlier this month. Waymo&#39;s autonomous ride-hailing service is also available in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.&nbsp;&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/tesla-gets-approval-for-ride-hailing-business-in-california-125100455.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Carl Erik Rinsch, the director of 47 Ronin , has been charged for defrauding a streaming service out of $11 million, according to the Southern District of New York&#39;s US Attorney&#39;s Office . While the court documents didn&#39;t name the service, an old report from The New York Times made it obvious that it was none other than Netflix . In 2018, Rinsch pitched a sci-fi series called White Horse , referencing the first horseman of the apocalypse, to several services, namely Amazon, Apple, HBO, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube. The Times&#39; report said that Amazon had already won the bidding war, but Netflix&#39;s former VP of Original Content, Cindy Holland, called Rinsch on a weekend and offered millions more, along with the privilege of making a director&#39;s cut.&nbsp; In its announcement of the indictment, the US Attorney&#39;s Office explained that Netflix had paid $44 million for the development of White Horse, which had been renamed to Conquest , between 2018 and 2019. Some of that money went to paying off the project&#39;s earliest investors. (Keanu Reeves, the star of 47 Ronin , sank his own money into the project after Rinsch got in trouble with 30West, one of the project&#39;s first investors, for not reaching a deadline.) Between late 2019 and early 2020, Rinsch asked Netflix for more funding, and the company gave him $11 million more to complete the series. But Rinsch never finished the show, and Netflix accused him of using those funds to make &quot;personal and speculative purchases of securities.&quot; The director allegedly lost most of the $11 million to trading, but he made it back and earned more from investing the rest on cryptocurrency. Rinsch allegedly went on a shopping spree after that, spending almost $4 million on furniture and antiques, $2.4 million on five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, as well as $652,000 on luxury watches and clothing. The indictment also said that Rinsch spent over $1 million to sue Netflix for more money. According to The Times&#39; report, Rinsch claimed in his lawsuit that Netflix broke its contract and owed him several more payments worth $14 million. In the midst of all of these, Rinsch reportedly displayed erratic behavior: He allegedly claimed to have discovered Covid-19’s secret transmission mechanism, treated the show&#39;s staff horribly and accused his wife of plotting his assassination. Conquest was supposed to be about a genius who invented a human-like species called Organic Intelligent. These OIs are deployed to solve problems and provide humanitarian aid around the world, but they are, of course, not what they seem and are hiding a darker nature. Rinsch has been charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, both of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He was also charged with five counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, each count carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years.

    "description": "Playdate , the little yellow gaming machine with a crank, is getting a price increase in a few days. In a newsletter that Panic has sent out, the developer said that Playdates will cost $229 starting on March 25 but that you can still get the device for $199 until then. Apparently, Panic moved to a new factory, and it would &quot;cost quite a bit more&quot; to manufacture the devices there than at the company&#39;s old facility. Panic cited manufacturing costs, as well, when it raised the handheld&#39;s price from $179 to $199 last year.&nbsp; On the day the Playdate is getting a price hike, Panic is also dropping &quot;an (extremely) limited stock&quot; of systems that are either fully refurbished at its factory or have &quot;very minor cosmetic issues.&quot; The refurbished units will sell for $179, and Panic says that they &quot;work great,&quot; can &quot;play games perfectly&quot; and come with a six-month warranty. &quot;If price has kept you from buying a Playdate, we&#39;re hopeful these great systems might help,&quot; the company has written in its announcement.&nbsp; The handheld gaming console came out in 2022. It has a black-and-white screen with over 150 games that you can download from its Catalog. While the device has the traditional arrow and gaming buttons, it also has a crank that developers incorporate into their games — in Chopter Copter , for instance, you&#39;ll have to turn the Playdate on its side to use the crank as a helicopter-style rotor. If you already have a Playdate, the company is having a Catalog Anniversary Sale right now until March 20, where you can stock up on more titles for the handheld. Panic also reconfirmed that it&#39;s working with developers to put together a Season 2 bundle , which will deliver a set number of games in a curated collection to buyers&#39; devices over a certain period.

    "description": "There’s no better time than right now to kickstart those health and fitness goals. Whether you’re looking to shed a few pounds, track your muscle gains or stay on top of your wellness routine, a smart scale can be the perfect sidekick. These scales don’t just show you your weight; they provide insights into body composition, muscle mass and even your metabolic rate, all the while synching with your favorite health apps. Smart scales make staying on track easier than ever before, with many able to store multiple user profiles to track everyone in your household’s fitness journey. Plus, they’re designed for accuracy, giving you more confidence in your overall progress if, in those early days, you can’t see the benefits in the mirror. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a data geek or just want to feel healthier, there’s a smart scale out there to suit your needs. Table of contents Smart scale safety Best smart scales for 2025 What to look for in a smart scale How we tested and which smart scales we tested Smart scales FAQs Smart scale safety There are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat. Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.” A meta-analysis from 2016 found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A 2018 study , however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight. Best smart scales for 2025 What to look for in a smart scale Weight A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal. Connectivity Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised. Bone density The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass. Body fat percentage and muscle mass Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition monitor can measure your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. BMI A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both overly simplistic and often greatly misleading . Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care. Pulse Wave Velocity French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights. Wearables and integration Pairing your smart scale with wearables like fitness trackers or smartwatches can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place. Display Less a specification and more a note: Smart scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display. App and subscriptions You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware. Data portability Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere. All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.) Power It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails. How we tested and which smart scales we tested For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers: Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2 Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four. Fitbit Aira Air Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway. Anker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health. It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat. Omron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product. A solid, reliable, sturdy, strong (checks the dictionary for more synonyms) dependable piece of kit. There’s no romance or excitement on show, but you can trust that however joyless it may be, it’ll do the job in question and will be user-friendly. The hardware is limited, the app is limited, but it certainly (checks synonyms again) is steady. Joking aside, Omron’s Connect app is as bare-bones as you can get, since it acts as an interface for so many of its products. Scroll over to the Weight page, and you’ll get your weight and BMI reading, and if you’ve set a fitness goal, you can see how far you’ve got to go to reach it. You can also switch to seeing a trend graph which, again, offers the most basic visualization of your workouts and progress. Garmin Index S2 Garmin’s got a pretty massive fitness ecosystem of its own, so if you’re already part of that world, its smart scale is a no-brainer. On one hand, the scale is one of the easiest to use, and most luxurious of the bunch, with its color screen and sleek design. I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail. If there’s a downside, it’s that Garmin’s setup won’t hold your hand, since it’s for serious fitness people, not newbies. Withings Body Comp At the highest end, Withings’ flagship Body Comp is luxurious, and luxuriously priced, a figure I’d consider to be “too much” to spend on a bathroom scale. For your money, however, you’ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of body composition metrics including your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin’s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware’s overall sleek look. Withings Body Scan If you want to flaunt your cash, you don’t buy a car, you buy a super car, or a hyper car if you’re flush enough. What then, do we call Withings’ $400 Body Scan if not a super -smart scale, or a hyper -smart scale? As well as doing everything the Body Comp does, plus running a six-lead ECG, segmented body composition, and will even check for neuropathy in your feet. It is the best scale I’ve ever used, it is also the most expensive, and I suspect it’s too much device for almost everyone who’d consider buying one. Smart scales FAQs What&#39;s the difference between a smart scale and a regular scale? A regular scale is pretty straightforward — it tells you how much you weigh, and that’s usually it. A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model. What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing. How do smart scales work with more than one person using it? When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it. Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.

    "description": "If you’ve upgraded your phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports wireless charging. Battery life can be one of the first things to deteriorate as your phone ages, so you’ll need quick and easy ways to power up wherever you are. You may not always be able to have a cable on your person, but investing in a wireless phone charger (or a few) can make it more convenient to plop your phone down and know it’ll have more juice when you pick it back up again. While you’re not going to get the same charging speed with a wireless charger that you would with a power cable, the convenience of a power source like this is undeniable. Stick a wireless charger on your bedside, on your desk at work, in your kitchen or wherever you spend a good chunk of your time and you’ll have a reliable way to power up your phone, sans bulky, messy cables. Needless to say, there are a ton of options out there with different charging capabilities and price ranges. Below, we’ve collected the best wireless chargers we’ve tested to make your search a little easier. Table of contents Best wireless chargers for 2025 What to look for in a wireless charger Where and how will you use your charger? Wireless charging performance Quality and box contents Wireless chargers FAQs Best wireless chargers for 2025 What to look for in a wireless charger While it’s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a multi-device wireless charger . Where and how will you use your charger? Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours. For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For travelling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Wireless charging performance Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones. There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple’s latest MagSafe charging pad can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter — the latter being another component you’ll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can. Quality and box contents Pay attention to what’s included in the box. Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link. Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs. You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station. Wireless chargers FAQs Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case? Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported. How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging? Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.” Do cords charge your phone faster? Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.

    "description": "President Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to remake the US government continued today with the firing of the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission. This agency has historically had five members: three from the same party as the president and two from the opposing party. The New York Times reported that the president terminated the roles for FTC Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya.&nbsp; Both Slaughter and Bedoya said today that firing them is illegal. Commissioners&#39; terms can only be ended early for good cause , such as &quot;inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.&quot; Also, no more than three commissioners can come from the same political party, meaning the pair also cannot be replaced by additional Republicans. It seems likely that Trump will face a legal challenge over the attempt to eliminate these positions. &quot;The law protects the independence of the Commission because the law serves the American people, not corporate power,&quot; Slaughter said in a statement. &quot;The reason that the FTC can be so effective for the American people is because of its independence and because its commissioners serve across political parties and ideologies. Removing opposition voices may not change what the Trump majority can do, but it does change whether they will have accountability when they do it.&quot; Bedoya also posted about the action on X, seconding Slaughter&#39;s statement that removing their posts is illegal. &quot;Tomorrow I will testify before the Colorado Joint House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and will have more to say then,&quot; he wrote. Trump signed an executive order in February attempting to exert more control over several agencies that were formed to intentionally remain outside the White House&#39;s purview. The order targeted agencies such as the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FTC recently deleted all the posts on its business blog from President Biden&#39;s administration, leaving a four-year gap with no published compliance advice.

    "description": "The Federal Trade Commission has removed all posts from President Joe Biden&#39;s term in office from its business blog. This online publication has historically provided advice about how companies could best comply with consumer-protection regulations, covering topics such as artificial intelligence and how big tech companies have collected and used customer data. Currently, it has no content published between December 21, 2020 and March 7, 2025. Wired highlighted some of the notable content from the more than 300 blog posts that have been deleted. Several current and former FTC officials spoke to the publication about the change anonymously out of fear of retaliation. “In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” one source said. The FTC is being led by President Donald Trump&#39;s nominee, Andrew Ferguson. At the time of his appointment, Ferguson said he would use the department to &quot;end Big Tech&#39;s vendetta against competition and free speech.&quot; He and other Republicans have claimed that many platforms are censoring right-wing content, adding a heavy layer of irony to the FTC&#39;s latest actions. &quot;They are talking a big game on censorship,&quot; another source told Wired . &quot;But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies&#39; bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-ftc-has-removed-all-business-blog-posts-from-the-biden-administration-214734633.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Starting Tuesday, Disney+ has a 24/7 streaming channel for The Simpsons that broadcasts seasons one through 35 (all but the currently airing one) chronologically. To be clear, this announcement isn&#39;t about any new content, as you can already watch each of those 767 episodes on-demand on Disney+. All that&#39;s different here is a single stream that runs through each of them in order around the clock. If episodes average 22 minutes long, that would have the stream taking nearly 12 days to refresh.

    "description": "NVIDIA is building a desktop supercomputer. At the company&#39;s GTC conference today, CEO Jensen Huang announced DGX Spark and DGX Station. We got a first look at the former during CES earlier this year when Huang and company revealed Project Digits . Now known as DGX Spark, NVIDIA is billing the $3,000 device as the world&#39;s smallest AI supercomputer.&nbsp; It features a GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip NVIDIA has shrunk down to fit inside an enclosure about the size of the previous generation Mac mini . NVIDIA says the GB10 can run up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of AI compute, making it ideal for fine-tuning the latest AI reasoning models, including the GR00T N1 robot system Huang announced at the end of his GTC keynote. The DGX Spark is available to preorder today.&nbsp; NVIDIA For researchers and data scientists who need even more AI processing power, the DGX Station features a GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Desktop Superchip. The GB300 offers 20 petaflops of performance and 784GB of unified system memory. NVIDIA has yet to announce a price for the DGX Station, though the company says the computer will arrive later this year, with ASUS, BOXX, Dell, HP, Lambda and Supermicro all making their own versions of the system.

    "description": "HP is launching a thinner and lighter version of its Omen 16 gaming laptop. The Omen 16 Slim is 16 percent thinner than the standard model , ranging from 0.78 to 0.89 inches (19.9 to 22.7 mm) thick when closed. It weighs 5.35 lbs. The HP Omen 16 Slim includes up to NVIDIA RTX 5070 graphics (no word yet on the cheaper configurations). It uses Intel Arrow Lake processors , ranging from the entry-level Core Ultra 5 225H to the Core Ultra 9 285H. You can fit it with 16GB, 24GB or 32GB of RAM and choose between 512GB and 1TB storage tiers. As its name suggests, it has a 16-inch display with up to 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. (Cheaper configs are limited to 1,920 x 1,200.) The machine includes a 10Gbps USB-C port, along with a 10Gbps Type-A, two 5Gbps Type-A ports, an RJ-45 ethernet connector, a 3.5mm headphone / mic combo jack and a single HDMI 2.1 port. There&#39;s no official word yet on pricing or a release date, but The Verge reports that HP is targeting a May launch.

    "description": "HyperX just introduced a new wireless headset that can keep rocking for up to 200 hours on a single charge. That’s over a week of constant music. The Cloud III S is a followup to 2023’s original wireless headset, but brings Bluetooth audio into the mix. The robust battery allows for the aforementioned 200 hours of listening when using Bluetooth. That metric drops to around 120 hours when streaming audio via a 2.4GHz wireless connection. Just like the original, the headphones ship with a USB dongle for 2.4GHz. However, it can connect without a dongle when using certain newer HP Omen gaming laptops . HyperX A long-lasting battery isn’t the only innovation the Cloud III S brings to the table. It’s also fully customizable, via magnetic ear plates. These are 3D-printed on demand, which is something HyperX has been experimenting with for a while . Users can create and buy these customized 3D-printed ear plates directly from HyperX, but only in select countries. There’s also a removable boom mic for traveling, but that won’t impede the ability to take calls or trash talk other gamers. The headphones feature a backup omni-directional mic, which is a nice touch. The HyperX Cloud III S is expected to hit store shelves in May, but pricing hasn’t been solidified yet. For reference, the original Cloud III launched for $170. The new headset will be available in an all-back or black and red.

    "description": "Sarah Wynn-Williams joined Facebook in 2011 when it was very much in its “move fast and break things” era. A former United Nations diplomat, she had aspirations of helping Facebook boost its standing on the global stage. Over nearly seven years at the company, she had a front-row seat to some of Facebook’s most consequential (and controversial) moments. Last week, she published Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism , a memoir about her time at the company and how she slowly became disillusioned about Facebook’s role in the world. Since it was announced, Meta has thrown the full weight of its PR machine against the book. The company initiated arbitration proceedings, which resulted in a ruling that now prevents Wynn-Williams from promoting her own book. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the arbitrator’s decision “affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published.” He said that “urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry’s standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years.” Her publisher, Flatiron Books, said in a statement it was “appalled” by Meta’s actions, noting that “the arbitrator&#39;s order makes no reference to the claims” in the book, which “went through a thorough editing and vetting process.” After reading the book, it’s easy to see why Meta PR has made such a fuss. Wynn-Williams worked closely with the company’s top executives, traveling around the world with Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg as they met with foreign leaders and shaped the policies that would define Facebook. She also delivers many firsthand accounts of what Zuckerberg, Sandberg and current Chief of Global Affairs Joel Kaplan did and said behind closed doors. Much of it isn’t pretty. Here are some of her most shocking claims: Zuckerberg requested to be “gently mobbed” during a visit to Asia Wynn-Williams was often tasked with organizing the meetings various Facebook executives took with heads of state and other government officials. One of the more bizarre details is Zuckerberg’s request ahead of a three-week long trip to Asia. According to Wynn-Williams, Zuckerberg requested that she arrange either a “peace rally” or a “riot” during his visit. Facebook’s CEO never explains the request, but Wynn-Williams speculates he wanted &quot;to test out how effective his product is in turning Facebook’s online tools into offline power.” At first, I think he&#39;s joking. Peace rallies are not my area of expertise, and-to be frank-I&#39;ve never been asked to organize a riot before. Especially one for a tech CEO. I assume something has been lost in his communication-that it&#39;s some sort of mix-up. &quot;Riot&quot; and &quot;peace rally&quot; are such completely different things. Then Debbie emails to say that she ran into Mark and he told her that he wants a peace rally or a riot and we need to come up with some ideas that will enable him to be surrounded by people or be &quot;gently mobbed.&quot; Zuckerberg refused to take meetings before noon, even with heads of state Zuckerberg apparently had a “strict” policy about not taking any meetings before noon. This policy applied not only to internal meetings with others at Facebook, but heads of state. Wynn-Williams recounts how Zuckerberg’s “refusal” to take morning meetings almost derailed a planned meeting with the president of Colombia. That same year, she said she was forced to reschedule Zuckerberg’s address at the UN to a later time slot because, according to Wynn-Williams, “the United Nations isn’t important enough for Mark to do an event before noon.” Meta built Zuckerberg a special room to protect him from Zika Facebook took “extreme measures” to protect Zuckerberg from Zika during a visit to Peru for the APEC conference. To protect the CEO, who was apparently hoping to soon conceive his second child, the company opted &quot;to build a ‘controlled structure’ on the site of the APEC conference center where ventilation, exposure to others, and bug mitigation can be overseen by Facebook.” Wynn-Williams dubbed it “operation perfect sperm.” Zuckerberg’s “desperate” attempts to talk to Xi Jinping Wynn-Williams spends a lot of time delving into Facebook’s plans to bring the social network to China . She also details Zuckerberg’s attempts to get face time with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In 2015, Zuckerberg flew to Seattle for a “longer than normal” handshake with Xi (who was in the city for a tech summit Zuckerberg was not invited to). He later caused a “diplomatic crisis” when he posted a photo of that handshake, which only shows the back of Xi’s head. The following year, Zuckerberg and his team hoped to surreptitiously get the CEO in front of Xi at APEC in Peru. Facebook arranged for Zuckerberg to give a speech directly before an appearance by Xi, which meant the two men would be in adjacent dressing rooms. The goal, according to Wynn-Williams, was to engineer a “spontaneous encounter” during which Zuckerberg could make his pitch to get Facebook into China. But when Xi arrived, he was flanked by “dozens and dozens” of men in military uniforms who created a barrier such that, according to Wynn-Williams, Xi didn&#39;t even have to “risk making eye contact with Mark.” She says that Zuckerberg was “hurt” by the demonstration. Sheryl Sandberg wanted Facebook to promote organ donation Not long after starting at Facebook, Wynn-Williams says she was told that “Facebook’s first proactive initiative to build relationships with governments around the world will be organ donation.” The idea was apparently Sandberg’s, who ran into a former Harvard friend and transplant surgeon and “offered to help him source donors.” But when Wynn-Williams brought up the logistical and legal issues that generally make it difficult to transport organs between countries, she says Sandberg was “indignant.” “Do you mean to tell me that if my four-year-old was dying and the only thing that would save her was a new kidney, that I couldn’t fly to Mexico and get one and put it in my handbag?” Facebook would later add organ donation to the “life events” users could add to their profiles. Sheryl Sandberg and the plane crash that wasn&#39;t In 2013, an Asiana flight from Seoul to San Francisco crash-landed on a runway, killing two people and injuring more than 100 passengers. Sandberg, who was promoting her book Lean In at the time, was also traveling from Seoul to San Francisco that day. Following the crash, she posted on Facebook that she and several Facebook colleagues were originally meant to be on that flight but had “switched to United so we could use miles for my family&#39;s tickets.” Sandberg’s supposed near-miss generated multiple headlines, which isn’t surprising, as Wynn-Williams claims Sandberg was personally briefing reporters about the incident. Wynn-Williams was baffled by these reports. She writes that the Facebook COO “always flies United” and “never considered Asiana.” In her recollection, she and another colleague remarked to each other how “weird” it was for Sandberg to do this. Why Zuckerberg and Sandberg’s Facebook posts get so much engagement Wynn-Williams heavily implies that there may be some behind-the-scenes manipulation of Zuckerberg and Sandberg’s Facebook posts. She doesn’t offer any proof that this has happened, but says that a meeting attended by “someone from Mark’s personal communications team” raises the possibility. According to Wynn-Williams, “Sheryl’s assistant describes his job as managing ‘engagement for Mark and Sheryl&#39;s social media using all of Facebook&#39;s tools.’” When Wynn-Williams asks directly if they are “gaming” the site’s algorithm, she says the assistant replies that “you don’t want to know.” Joel Kaplan needed a geography lesson Some of the most telling anecdotes in Careless People involve Kaplan, who joined Facebook’s policy team in 2011 and was promoted to Chief Global Affairs Officer earlier this year. She writes that Kaplan, who was a deputy chief of staff in the George W. Bush White House, was “surprised to learn Taiwan is an island” and that “often when we start to talk about pressing issues in some country in Latin America or Asia, he stops and asks me to explain where the country is.” Kaplan slow-rolled Facebook’s response to problems in Myanmar By now, Meta’s failures in Myanmar, where hate speech and misinformation on Facebook helped incite a genocide , are well documented. Wynn-Williams, who early in her tenure flew to Myanmar to try to sell officials there on the company’s connectivity projects, describes her futile attempts to get more resources for content moderation in the country. She blames Kaplan in particular. She says she “started this long process of trying to hire someone for Myanmar in 2015” and found a human rights expert who fit the bill in May 2016, but Kaplan blocked her from making the hire in February of 2017. He allegedly told her to “move on and get over it.” She later concludes that “when it came to Myanmar, those people just didn’t matter to him.” (Meta had broadly labeled Wynn-Williams’ claims about Facebook’s actions in Myanmar as “old news,” saying in a statement that “the facts here have been public record since 2018, and we have said publicly we know we were too slow to act on abuse on our services in Myanmar.”) Kaplan’s alleged harassment Wynn-Williams also accuses Kaplan of harassment and other inappropriate behavior. After complications while giving birth left her in a literal coma, she writes that Kaplan asked her over one of their “regular” calls during her maternity leave “where are you bleeding from” and got angry when she didn&#39;t answer. Later, when she returned to work, he gave her an unofficial performance review on her first day back, saying that she wasn’t “responsive enough.” Wynn-Williams eventually reports Kaplan’s behavior and an investigation is opened, but that “very quickly it seems to switch from an investigation of Joel, or the facts, to an investigation of me.” She’s fired at her next performance review. Meta has disputed Wynn-Williams&#39; allegations. “ This book is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,&quot; a spokesperson said in a statement. &quot;Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.&quot; Update, March 18, 2025, 1:57 PM PT: Wynn-Williams describes her tenure at Facebook as lasting seven years, beginning in 2011. But, according to a Meta spokesperson, she was fired in &quot;late 2017.&quot; This story has been updated to reflect that she worked at Facebook for &quot;nearly&quot; seven years.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-stream-every-march-madness-2025-game-181552865.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The brackets are set and the teams are en route to their respective arenas. The 2025 NCAA Tournaments, affectionately known to many as March Madness , begin this week. The men’s tournament begins first on March 18 with the women’s version tipping off on March 19. Both will begin with First Four or “play-in” games (depending on who you ask) before providing action on the court through the first weekend in April. Different broadcasters own the rights to each tournament, so streaming them both can be confusing. I’ve broken down the best, most affordable way to access each one so that you&#39;ll be ready when the games begin. When does March Madness start? The men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament begins on Tuesday, March 18 with two of the so-called First Four matchups. These are the four games that are used to determine the final four teams in the main 64-team bracket. To some, they’re known as the “play-in games” although they’ve officially been part of the men&#39;s tournament since 2011. The first game on March 18 begins at 6:40PM ET with another to follow at 9:10PM ET. The same schedule is expected for the second slate of games on Wednesday, March 19. On the women’s side, March Madness is offset from the men’s tournament by a day. The first two of the First Four games are Wednesday, March 19 at 7PM ET and 9PM ET. The second pair of matchups follows on Thursday, March 20 in the same two time slots. The 64-team bracket kicks off in earnest for the men at 12:15PM ET on Thursday, March 20. For the women, the main action begins at 11:30AM ET on Friday, March 21st. Here’s the full schedule for each tournament: 2025 Men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament First Four: March 18-19 First round: March 20-21 Second round: March 22-23 Sweet 16: March 27-28 Elite Eight: March 29-30 Final Four: April 5 Championship game: April 7 2025 Women’s NCAA Basketball Tournament First Four: March 19-20 First round: March 21-22 Second round: March 23-24 Sweet 16: March 28-29 Elite Eight: March 30-31 Final Four: April 4 Championship game: April 6 How to stream the 2025 Men’s NCAA Tournament ASSOCIATED PRESS CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery share the broadcast rights to the men’s tournament, and as they have in years past, TV coverage will be spread across four networks. During the course of March Madness, games will air on CBS, TNT, TBS and truTV, with the final rounds and championship game landing on CBS. If you already have a paid TV plan (such as traditional cable), the best way to watch the men’s tournament is with the March Madness Live app or website. Once you log in with your TV provider credentials, you can watch every game in one spot with features like multiview (up to four games at once) and “excitement alerts” that let you know when there’s a close game. The app also offers ways to follow your bracket, if you filled it out on MarchMadness.com. And when you’re watching on desktop, the crucial Boss Button will throw up a fake work screen when you need it. March Madness Live is also available on Amazon, Fire TV, Apple TV, iOS, macOS, Google Play, LG smart TVs, Roku and Xbox devices. If you don’t have a compatible TV provider already, your best option is to actually use two services. It’s not ideal, I know, but it will save you a lot of money. Max’s Standard plan is $17/month and gives you access to live games from TNT, TBS and truTV. While you can watch NCAA Tournament games with the Basic with Ads tier, B/R Sports, which powers all of the live coverage on Max, will only be available on Standard and Premium levels starting March 30. Yes, Warner Bros. Discovery set its policy to change in the middle of the tournament to make more money. For the CBS games, you’ll need a Paramount+ with Showtime subscription that costs $13/month. So, in total, your best option to stream all of the men’s tournament is $30 spread across two apps.&nbsp; A live TV service like YouTube TV or Hulu plus Live TV is over $50 more per month at full price, but they would offer you “one-stop shopping” for all the games in the men’s tournament. YouTube TV is currently on sale for $70/month for the first six months you use it.&nbsp; How to stream the 2025 Women’s NCAA Tournament ASSOCIATED PRESS While Warner Brothers Discovery owns the rights to the men’s NCAA Tournament, ESPN has the women’s bracket locked down. Every game of the women’s tournament will be spread across ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNEWS, including the First Four matchups. The Final Four will be on ESPN, but the championship game will air on ABC. All three of those culminating games will stream on ESPN+. Since ESPN+ won’t get every game, it’s not an option if you want to watch the entire tournament. You will be able to watch “select matchups” on both ESPN+ and Disney+, but ESPN hasn’t announced what those will be. So, unfortunately, your best bet is a live-TV streaming service like Sling, YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV for a comprehensive experience. Sling is the cheapest avenue here, with the requisite Orange and Sports Extra plans costing $34 (Sling is currently offering a discount on the first month of Orange). YouTube and Hulu live TV options are both the same price at $83/month (YouTube TV currently discounted to $70 for the first six months), so it’s a matter of which set of content and features you like best. YouTube TV offers a handy multiview tool so you can watch up to four games at once, but Hulu + Live TV comes with Disney+ and ESPN+ (both with ads) for that cost. (Opting for Hulu + Live TV only saves you one whole dollar per month if you don’t include the Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu bundling.) If you’re a more casual fan who can afford to roll the dice on the “select” options on ESPN+, you can save some money. That service only costs $12/month. And if you already have a TV plan that includes the ESPN family of networks, the ESPN app is the best place to watch the tournament. The mix of scores and info, along with multiview streaming for up to four games at a time on Apple TV and Xbox, make the app a well-equipped conduit for the women’s tournament. The March Madness website only shows scores and news for the women’s tournament. There are no live games available on the website. What if I want to stream both the men’s and women’s tournaments? ASSOCIATED PRESS If you’re hoping to stream all of both the men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments, I hope you ordered Samsung’s eight-TV bundle . In terms of streaming services, just jump straight to a live-TV option like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV. I prefer the former because of its multiview feature – a tool that Hulu doesn’t offer. At times when there are multiple games that you want to watch, especially during the first two rounds, you’ll want multiview in order to keep tabs on all of the action. Are any of the March Madness games available to stream for free? You can watch all of the games broadcast on CBS on the March Madness website and mobile apps without a TV provider. Sure, it’s a small sample of the tournament, but it’s completely free and a good option for casual fans who don’t have a paid TV plan they can exploit for more of the action. It’s also a good option for watching the first round at work, if your company hasn’t blocked streaming sites, or if you can discreetly watch on your phone. For the women’s tournament, there aren’t any games available for free. Unless you have an old-school OTA antenna, in which case you can watch men’s games on CBS and women’s games on ABC without any kind of streaming plan. Of course, this is a streaming guide so I’d consider an antenna an extraordinary move in 2025. If you were hoping to use a free trial period to watch March Madness, I’ve got bad news. None of them will be long enough to watch an entire tournament. Some of them don’t offer them at all, but the longest is YouTube TV at 10 days which wouldn’t get you through the second weekend.

    "description": "Microsoft just announced that its Xbox Adaptive Joystick is now available for purchase directly from the company. This news comes during the annual Ability Summit. The Adaptive Joystick is designed for people with limited mobility , so it has four customizable button inputs on the front and two more mappable bumper and trigger-style buttons. It also comes with a standard thumbstick. It costs $30, which is cheaper than the official wireless Xbox controller. That’s just one accessibility-minded announcement that Microsoft made today. The company is bringing AI tools to the screen-reader Narrator for Windows . This will allow the software to offer “rich image descriptions.” It’ll be available to Windows Insider members sometime this spring. Microsoft Teams is also getting an update for those who are hard of hearing. The software will soon be able to automatically recognize when someone is using sign language, placing them prominently as a speaker during the meeting. This is what Sign Language View already does, but it’s an opt-in service. The update streamlines the process. It’ll be available later this year. The company has long been at the forefront of accessibility-related tech. It made a nifty Adaptive Mouse that allows for near-endless customization options. Microsoft also created technology that pairs game controllers without forcing users to touch the console and a kit to make Surface laptops more accessible . The brand first introduced the original Adaptive Controller around six years ago.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-xbox-adaptive-joystick-is-now-available-183009651.html?src=rss",

    "description": "BYD has introduced new technology for charging electric vehicles at vastly quicker speeds. Founder Wang Chuanfu said this &quot;super e-platform&quot; tech offers a peak charging speed of 1,000 kilowatts, twice that of the 500 kw charging currently offered by Tesla&#39;s superchargers. That would mean a car can travel 249 miles (400 kilometers) from a five-minute charge on a BYD station. This charging architecture will initially be available in two of BYD&#39;s vehicle models: the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV. &quot;In order to completely solve our user&#39;s charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,&quot; said Wang. The company is also bringing its quick-charging tech to Chinese drivers for the first time. BYD plans to construct 4,000 ultra-fast charging units across the country, although it did not provide a timeline or budget for the endeavor. To date, owners of BYD vehicles have needed to use charging stations from third-party operators or different EV manufacturers such as Tesla. BYD has been putting more and more EVs on the road around the world. Last year, its second-quarter shipment figures jumped 21 percent to draw very close to Tesla&#39;s numbers.

Amazon has the product, which usually costs $470, on sale for $300. That&#39;s nearly a record low. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson&#39;s fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we&#39;ve ever seen this product&#39;s price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we&#39;re nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for.

    "description": "Roku has begun running video ads that automatically play before loading the home screen, as reported by Ars Technica . This is impacting owners of Roku-branded smart TVs and streaming sticks, so long as the device runs the company’s proprietary OS. It’s worth noting that Roku users already see commercials on the home screen itself, so folks have to suffer through an ad to get to the ads. Multiple users have reported seeing commercials for the movie Moana 2 , though there does seem to be an option to close the video. A Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirmed the new ad placement but said it&#39;s just a test. The company declined to comment on whether or not this would become a permanent fixture within the OS. Our business “has and will always require continuous testing and innovation across design, navigation, content, and our first-rate advertising products,” the statement read. “Our recent test is just the latest example, as we explore new ways to showcase brands and programming while still providing a delightful and simple user experience.” Roku is trying pushing how far to enshittify by introducing ad autoplay before the home screen. &quot;I just turned on my Roku and got an unskippable ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.&quot; Speak up before experiment turns into reality. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/NUkmHoemts — Techlore (@TechloreInc) March 18, 2025 As expected, Roku users aren’t exactly pumped about this new ad-delivery method. Some have suggested that they would get rid of their devices if the company keeps the test going. Many consumers have expressed that they are fine with the static ads seen on the home screen, but that a loud video is simply a bridge too far. As a whole, Smart TVs have become a serious growth market for advertisements. These TVs are high-tech and, as such, they track our viewing habits at nearly every turn. Some companies actually lose money on the hardware and make most of their profits via our eyeballs. Roku, as an example, lost $44 million on its physical devices in 2023, but made nearly $1.6 billion with its ads and services products.

    "description": "It&#39;s unlikely that the fate of a company as large as Ubisoft will hinge on the success of one tentpole single-player game. But the company cannot afford another major error anytime soon after the likes of Star Wars: Outlaws and XDefiant &nbsp; failed to set the world alight. Ubisoft desperately needs a big hit (and for the Rainbow Six Siege X overhaul to go well). The good news for the company is that Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows is poised to deliver on that. On the surface, it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect: a massive Assassin&#39;s Creed game that takes dozens of hours to beat. There&#39;s so much to do beyond the core story, given all the missions and sidequests that the game constantly points you towards. I was rarely bored during my time with the game — not even during the lengthy flashbacks — which says a lot about the care and consideration Ubisoft&#39;s developers have put into this giant world and the story that ties it together. Ubisoft could not risk having the game run poorly from the jump and then spend months fixing it à la Cyberpunk 2077 . Thankfully, for the most part, Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows runs well across my consoles (base PS5 and Xbox Series X) and PC. It looks sumptuous on my high-end gaming rig, which has an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 14th-gen i9 Intel CPU and 32GB of RAM. I had zero issues while running everything at very high settings. The action hovered in the 55-59 fps range with no considerable framerate drops — save for the slightly jarring switch to cutscenes, which play out at 30 fps. It&#39;s worth noting that Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows is verified for Steam Deck, but I wasn&#39;t able to test it out there. There were no noticeable slowdowns even in the heat of chaotic combat on the three platforms I played on. However, I did spot some small visual aberrations on PS5. Early on, while strolling through puddles in performance mode, water pooling on a dirt track shimmered in an unnatural way. It distracted me from the conversation I was having with an ally. Ubisoft Once I was in winter, textures on the grass that poked through the snow faded out and in while I tore through the countryside on horseback. For the record, that happened in balanced mode, which attempts to split the difference between the quality and performance modes in terms of visual fidelity versus framerate. These are minor complaints, in fairness, but they momentarily broke the immersion for me. The main other weird quirk is that my horse often got stuck when I whistled for it. If, say, I was on a narrow bridge when I called the steed, it might spawn into the river below. A slight annoyance that&#39;s more to do with how the horse is programmed to catch up to you by your side, but one that&#39;s forgivable considering some of the many narrow paths you&#39;ll venture along. Two heroes with their own stories The big hook this time around is that you can swap between two characters almost whenever you like. Naoe, a shinobi, is a more traditional Assassin&#39;s Creed protagonist, while the warrior Yasuke is a hulking samurai who can bust through doors and carry bodies to hiding spots more easily than his counterpart. There are missions and character interactions that require you to specifically play as one character, but for the most part, you can play as either in the open world. I stuck to Naoe as much as I could. She&#39;s far more nimble and capable at clambering around strongholds — her grappling hook is such a handy tool — and carrying out stealthy assassinations. After all, she’s the only one of the two who has the fabled hidden blade. Her movement is extremely fluid, an aspect of the game that&#39;s said to have benefited from the extra time developers had amid its delays . Unlike Yasuke, Naoe can use the classic eagle vision ability to reveal enemies, hiding spots and goodies through walls. She&#39;s plenty capable in hand-to-hand combat as well, more so as you unlock abilities like the very useful double assassination. Her kusarigama , which consists of a sickle-like implement and heavy weight linked by a chain, is a great part of her arsenal. That&#39;s not to say Yasuke isn&#39;t a fun character as well. Silently thinning out enemy numbers with his bow or loudly with a teppō firearm before charging in to eliminate the remainder with a long katana, crushing club and special moves like booting a grunt into a wall never got old. Both protagonists are well-written and performed, at least while playing with English audio. However, the lip syncing didn&#39;t always neatly match up with what the characters were saying, a distraction in cutscenes. While I didn&#39;t get around to playing the game in immersive mode, with characters speaking in their native tongues of Japanese and Portuguese, I&#39;d be interested to see if the lip sync issue is as prominent there. Personal stakes with a broader goal Nevertheless, the story was strong enough to hold my attention during the cutscenes and the rest of the game. It&#39;s a tale that starts with very personal stakes for both heroes but expands to involve safeguarding the future of Japan. The writers have crafted a narrative with plenty of intrigue and intricacy, and I enjoyed how they weaved the broader Assassin&#39;s Creed lore into Shadows. I would say the story and structure are rich and intricate enough to justify the 40-60 hours it&#39;ll take many people to finish this game. (The new scouting system — which you&#39;ll use to narrow down the location of an objective after learning that, for instance, a target is in a specific area — works well.) Still, I preferred the tighter 20-hour approach Ubisoft took with Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage . Ubisoft I enjoyed playing in canon mode, which removed dialogue choices and let narrative beats play out as the designers intended. It&#39;s too much of a spoiler to reveal how Naoe and Yasuke come to be allies, but the interactions between them and other characters, particularly the flirty relationship Naoe has with one firearm-wielding figure, are for the most part captivating enough. The performers (and, my goodness, are there a lot of speaking parts here) by and large do a great job with the material. But it&#39;s a bit jarring to hear a character speak in a plain North American accent when most of the cast bring Japanese and Portuguese inflections to their delivery. As solid as the tale being told is overall, the structure is a little odd in places. The main story includes flashback sequences, including one with a combat tutorial that takes place right after the action-packed prologue, that disrupt the flow even if they add some color to the protagonists&#39; backstories. Skill tree frustrations I&#39;m not a big fan of the way Ubisoft has structured the progression systems. Naoe and Yasuke each have six skill trees, all of which are broken down into levels. To unlock the next level, the player has to accumulate enough experience points by completing various side activities, including horse archery and finding hidden items dotted around temples. In a vacuum, these can be fun, but it gets a little frustrating when you have a lot of spare mastery points to spend on skills and you have to run around to honor some shrines or find meditation spots before you&#39;re able to acquire some of Naoe&#39;s and Yasuke&#39;s cooler moves. There are some other antiquated systems in the game. Defeating a rōnin — a samurai who has been hired to take out the heroes — in a fun fight earned me decent loot, including some legendary light armor. But I couldn&#39;t equip it, because my character hadn&#39;t quite reached a high enough level to simply put on some new rags. This doesn&#39;t make any logical sense. Scaling enemy difficulty from region to region, a trope that Ubisoft eschewed in Mirage, feels very tired here too. It&#39;s an artificial way of ramping up the difficulty and progression when other approaches like more creative level design, new enemy types and the player manually making the game harder in their settings can do the trick. Given the historical nature of the series, it does follow to a degree that some of Ubisoft’s gameplay ideas are stuck in the past. In general, I don&#39;t really care to spend my time scouring for gear upgrades just so I can stand a chance in a new area. That said, perks on certain equipment can come in handy. Skulking around castles to take out a few key enemies to unlock a chest with some valuable equipment felt rewarding — even just as a little something extra to do while I tried to make my way to a viewpoint on enemy turf. Castles are valuable strongholds and offer a defensive advantage against attackers, so it&#39;s only logical that the bad guys would be stationed around viewpoints, which reveal new points of interest visible to our heroes after they scale up to a specific perch. Ubisoft Even without that gameplay aspect, scaling up to a viewpoint is always worth it, as has long been the case in the Assassin&#39;s Creed series. The minimum reward is a sweeping shot of the surrounding area, and since Shadows is such a stunner, I made it a point to claim every viewpoint along my path. The aforementioned puddle and grass anomalies aside, it’s a joy to roam around this gorgeous game, with its abundant foliage, carefully assembled settlements and dynamic weather system combining to form a rich, lived-in world that I won&#39;t soon forget. The lighting systems allowing for Naoe and Yaskue to snuff out candles and lanterns to help them hide in the shadows at night were a smart addition here too. There are plenty of other fun aspects to Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows . In one moment that reminded me of a beat in The Last of Us Part II , I was just starting a peaceful side activity when an assassin tried to take me out. That was an enjoyably unexpected twist. Meanwhile, an optional fight against a high-level enemy at the foot of a blazing tower in the middle of the night felt deeply cinematic. There&#39;s a lot riding on Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows . Ubisoft will absolutely be hoping that it&#39;s a success out of the gates and that not too many players wait for the price to drop. There&#39;s plenty of competition to be concerned about too, particularly as Sucker Punch Productions&#39; sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yōtei , is slated to arrive at some point this year. It does feel like there&#39;s enough here to draw in both Assassin&#39;s Creed diehards and newcomers who may be entranced by the 16th-century Japan setting but don’t know their Animus from their elbow. Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows has impressive technical work, great performances and an expansive, well-drawn story but it&#39;s unfortunately weighed down by some frustrating decisions and antiquated gameplay systems. Still, I&#39;m eager to keep exploring. Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Mac, Amazon Luna and Ubisoft+ on March 20. It will be available for iPad in the future.

    "description": "Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky just unveiled two new smartwatches that will be instantly familiar for long-time fans of the brand. The Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2 boast always-on e-paper displays, long-lasting batteries, physical buttons and simple designs that recall the company’s heyday . This is happening after Google open-sourced PebbleOS, which led Migicovsky to announce his plans to make watches for the platform he helped build. That was just six weeks ago and the units are already ready for pre-orders. He works fast, with a stated reasoning that “no one else has made a perfect smartwatch for people like us, so I’m going to make the exact smartwatch we want.” Eric Migicovsky To that end, the Core 2 Duo looks nearly identical to the iconic Pebble 2, though it has been upgraded with “modern chips and new tricks.” It features a 1.26-inch black and white e-paper display, a microphone, a lightweight polycarbonate frame and an impressive 30-day battery life. It tracks both sleep and steps, and includes a barometer and compass. Pre-orders are open right now , with shipments going out in July. The Core 2 Duo costs $149 and is available in black and white colorways. Eric Migicovsky Migicovsky calls the Core Time 2 his “dream watch” and that it’s the natural evolution from the well-reviewed Pebble Time and the unreleased Pebble Time 2 . It boasts a 64-color 1.5-inch e-paper display, a metal frame and buttons, a flat glass lens for better visibility and a battery that goes for around 30 days. The Core Time 2 also includes a touchscreen, heart rate monitor, microphone and speaker. It boasts IPX8 water-resistance and, of course, access to thousands upon thousands of pre-existing PebbleOS apps. Pre-orders are available now, though shipments won’t go out until December. It’s available in black or white, with a potential third color to be announced in the future, and costs $225. Being as PebbleOS is open-source, both watches are fully hackable. This allows for the potential introduction of custom firmware.

    "description": "Brick-building and monster-catching are about to converge, and parents&#39; wallets aren&#39;t ready. The Lego Group and The Pokémon Company said on Tuesday that their collaboration will bear (plastic) fruit starting next year. It sounds like the ideal companion for the upcoming Lego Game Boy. The companies haven&#39;t yet announced any Lego Pokémon sets — or, for that matter, anything beyond the fact that there is now a partnership and that they&#39;re targeting a 2026 release date. But the tease will likely give countless young (and old!) imaginations plenty to chew on until we know more. Children love building Legos and training Pokémon , so it&#39;s easy to imagine the collab shooting to the top of countless wishlists. While video games based on licensed Lego toy sets have been around for ages, licensed Lego sets based on video games are a newer phenomenon. Lego Minecraft has been around for over a decade , but recent years have also brought sets of Super Mario , Zelda , Overwatch and Sonic the Hedgehog in brick form. &quot;The LEGO Group and Pokémon have strong shared values of imagination, creativity and fun, making this the perfect partnership to deliver unique, meaningful and engaging ways for Trainers to experience the Pokémon brand,&quot; Gaku Susai, Chief Product and Experience Officer at The Pokémon Company International, wrote in a press release. &quot;Working with the best-in-class team at the LEGO Group and seeing their dedication and passion for the project has culminated in an innovative and groundbreaking collaboration that will surprise and delight fans.

    "description": "Apple just brought its Tap to Pay technology for iPhones to a host of new European countries , including Poland, Switzerland, Finland, Hungary, Portugal and several others. This allows for contactless payments. It works with credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and a number of third-party payment platforms. That last one was once a contentious issue for Apple. The company only allowed third-party developers access to its NFC technology, which powers Tap to Pay, after EU regulators threatened it with a massive antitrust fine . Apple has even agreed to allow users to make third-party wallets their default app. This means that many European customers will now be able to access third-party payment platforms without jumping through any hoops . For instance, iPhone users in Finland will be able to use Tap to Pay with Stripe, SumUp, Viva and many more. Hungarians will be able to use Adyen, Global Payment, myPOS and others. It’s a veritable cornucopia of NFC payment options. Thanks to the EU’s stiff regulations and the region’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), America has also gotten in on the act. The company recently opened up its NFC tech for third-party developers in the US and Canada. This functionality came in a software update as part of iOS 18.1. This feature works in today’s announced European countries so long as the customer has an iPhone Xs or newer and that they are running a recent iOS version. Merchants don’t need any additional hardware to complete transactions. Third-party payment platforms can also integrate Tap to Pay directly into their iOS apps.

    "description": "Since the start of March, Google has been aggressively expanding the availability of AI Overviews , dropping the requirement that you need to be logged into your Google account to access the feature. Now the company is bringing yet another AI tool to Search. The next time you go online to find medical information on your phone, you may see a new &quot; What People Suggest &quot; panel at the top of Google. Using AI, the feature will organize &quot;different perspectives from online discussions into easy-to-understand themes,&quot; explains Google. For instance, say you or one of your family members suffers from arthritis, the panel will curate &quot;real insights from people who also have the condition,&quot; with links so you can dig deeper. The feature is currently only available on mobile devices in the US. Google doesn&#39;t say how it plans to prevent the panel from surfacing misinformation. Instead, it mentions that it has worked to improve AI Overviews related to health topics so they &quot;continue to meet a high bar for clinical factuality.&quot; However, even after Google implemented additional safeguards to prevent AI Overviews from generating inaccurate summaries, and began using Gemini 2.0 to tackle more complicated questions, the feature can still return bizarre answers. For instance, an AI Overview recently told my colleague Kris Holt that the first day Canadians can start contributing toward their RRSP for 2026 starts on March 61. At the same event where Google debuted the What People Suggest panel, the company had other health-related announcements. The search giant said it was releasing a series of new Medical Records APIs through its Health Connect platform. With the update, Google says it will be easier to connect your health data with data from your doctor&#39;s office. Google also provided an update on the Pixel Watch 3&#39;s loss of pulse detection feature. After announcing it was coming soon with the latest Pixel feature drop , Google now says it will roll out at end of the month.

Several states — including New York, Texas and Virginia — have banned DeepSeek from government devices.

    "description": "Apple’s iPads get all the headlines , and with good reason: They’ve long been considered the best tablets for most people. But none of them come cheap. For folks on a tighter budget, I’ve spent the last few weeks testing a couple of 8-inch slates on the dirt-cheap end of the price spectrum: the $100 (but frequently discounted) Amazon Fire HD 8 and the $79 Walmart Onn 8” . They aren’t the only tablets available in this price range, but they’re pushed directly by the world’s two largest retailers, so there’s a good chance casual shoppers may buy them without knowing exactly what they’re getting. We pitted the two slates head-to-head not only to figure out which one is better, but also to diagnose the state of ultra-budget tablets as a whole. Balancing cheapness and utility You’ll never get truly “premium” hardware when you shop in this price range, but the Onn makes a nicer first impression than Amazon’s Fire tab. Squint hard enough and it sort of resembles a budget iPad mini , with a chilly aluminum back, squared-off edges and firm side buttons. Most people I handed it to over the course of this review were immediately surprised at how decent it felt for something so cheap. The Fire HD 8 wears its price more clearly. It’s mostly made from a hard textured plastic, with slightly thicker yet more rounded sides, thicker bezels and flimsier buttons. The front facing camera and dual speakers sit on the long edge, so it’s mainly designed to be held horizontally for streaming video or playing games. The Onn has a more traditional setup, with its selfie camera at the top and two speakers firing out the bottom edge, so it’s not as accommodating for media consumption or video calls. Despite the cheaper-feeling materials, I find the Fire HD 8 easier to hold for longer stretches. The gently curved sides don’t dig into your palms as much as the Onn’s flat edges, and while the larger bezels aren’t pretty, they give your thumbs a more natural place to sit. The Onn in particular can be prone to accidental inputs, something its thinner bezels exacerbate. That said, the Onn isn’t uncomfortable, it’s just more generic. In fact, it’s actually a half-inch narrower than Amazon’s tablet. With either device, you’re getting a tablet that’s just under 0.8 pounds — lightweight, highly portable and easy to hold with one hand. The $100 Amazon Fire HD 8 (left) and $79 Walmart Onn 8&quot; tablet. Jeff Dunn for Engadget The different perils of cheap tablet displays You won’t write home about either tablet’s 8-inch IPS LCD display, but the Onn’s panel is the surprisingly clear winner when you put the two side-by-side. Colors are noticeably less muted, black tones are deeper and the whole thing can get a bit brighter at its peak. White tones are too blue for me to call this screen accurate, but the Fire HD 8 tilts even farther in the other direction — it runs much warmer, which layers everything with an orange-ish hue. This makes it easier on the eyes at night, but it dulls colors, washes out black tones and generally looks dimmer by comparison. Beyond the tuning, both screens have similar drawbacks. Both are saddled with a low 1,280 x 800 resolution, which is sharp enough for displays this small but still makes text and images fuzzier than they’d appear on an iPad or pricier Android slate. Both have a basic 60Hz refresh rate. Neither is fully laminated, so there’s an air gap between the LCD and the display cover that makes scrolling feel less natural. This is especially noticeable on the Fire HD 8. (Apple’s base iPad has this same issue , but it’s an issue nonetheless.) Amazon’s tablet is also a major smudge and fingerprint magnet, plus it’s more difficult to read outdoors. The Onn doesn’t exactly excel in these areas either, but it’s better. And yet, much of the Onn’s advantage is negated by its lack of Widevine L1 support. Android Authority has a good explainer , but to simplify, Widevine is the Google-owned DRM platform used by many of the most popular video streaming services, including Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Paramount+ and Max. It has two security levels Android devices can support: L1 (the highest) or L3 (the lowest). If a device is only L3-compliant, like the Onn, video from these services is capped at a 480p resolution. Sure enough, shows and movies from those services are visibly less sharp on the Onn than they are on the Fire HD 8, which supports Widevine L1 and has no issues playing in 720p. This sucks. Netflix, Disney+ and the like are the apps many people buy a tablet to use, and while the Onn’s display is generally more vibrant, the difference isn’t nearly large enough to overcome video streams that look like they were ripped in 2010. A dimmer and overly warm image is still preferred if it’s the only one that supports HD across the board. Google doesn’t charge a license fee to implement its DRM tech, so there’s little excuse for Walmart — a $700 billion company — to ship a tablet that isn’t fully certified, even if it’s a cheapo model. Yet the Onn isn’t the only cheap Android tablet without full Widevine compliance. Consider it another way those on a tighter budget are let down by corporate laziness. The Onn has a slightly thinner but more boxy shape, while the Fire HD 8 has more rounded edges. Jeff Dunn for Engadget The other expected sacrifices There are several other hardware benefits you give up when you dive into the bargain bin, most of which are annoying but not terribly surprising. The cameras on both tablets are horrid, for one, blurring details and washing out colors even in full daylight. Neither tablet has a fingerprint reader for unlocking the device faster. Nor do they have formal water-resistance ratings, so you’ll want to be careful using either around the sink or tub. Both devices are equipped with a basic USB-C 2.0 port, and neither supports true fast charging. The Fire HD 8 can top up slightly quicker, as it supports up to a 15W charge compared to the Onn’s 10W, but even then Amazon only includes a 5W adapter in the box. The Fire HD 8 also has the edge when it comes to audio. It’s far from impressive: It can’t get very loud and it struggles to cleanly separate the different parts of tracks. But it’s decidedly fuller, warmer and more balanced than Walmart’s shrill speakers, which make vocalists sound like they’re shouting through a tin can. The Fire HD 8 can at least imply some level of bass too, whereas the Onn is pretty much devoid of it. The Onn also lacks a headphone jack, so you’re out of luck if you still like to keep a wired pair handy ( like me ). The side profiles of the two tablets. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Fast enough — barely Both the Onn and the Fire HD 8 are about as cheap as Android tablets get, and their performance follows suit. On paper, the former wins by a hair: Both come with 3GB of RAM, but Walmart’s slate runs on a 2 GHz eight-core chip (Mediatek MT8786), while Amazon’s uses a 2 GHz six-core processor (MediaTek MT8169). Along those lines, the Onn’s single- and multi-core performance was better than that of the Fire HD 8 in the Geekbench 5 benchmark (331 to 194 and 1317 to 950, respectively). In practice, however, there isn’t much difference. Both processors are as entry-level as it gets in 2025, and 3GB of RAM is the absolute minimum for passable performance. Geekbench 5 is an older version of that particular benchmark, but we had to use it because the latest Geekbench 6 straight-up doesn’t work on devices with less than 4GB of memory. With either tablet, you’re looking at light media consumption and little more. Apps, videos and ebooks load quickly enough to not completely annoy you. Web browsing is adequate so long as you don’t open more than a few tabs at a time. Casual card and match-three games play well enough, and you can run at least some more involved games like Diablo Immortal and PUBG Mobile if you knock them down to their lowest graphical settings. Streaming games over services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Amazon Luna works about as well as it does on any other device. (But we did notice that some games were capped at a lower resolution on Walmart’s tablet than they were on the Fire HD 8.) These are the kind of tasks ultra-cheap tablets are designed for, so this is what they can do. Even still, there will be hitches along the way. Pulling up the app drawer on the Onn sometimes took a second more than it should. There’s a slight but noticeable lag when you scroll down the home screen on the Fire HD 8. Multitasking or doing any serious work on either device is out of the question. Many graphically demanding mobile games won’t start at all. Some sites take frustratingly long to load, because the modern web simply isn’t designed for affordable devices like these — there are too many resource-hungry ads, images and auto-playing videos for them to truly keep up. The Amazon Fire HD 8. Jeff Dunn for Engadget If you want to keep score, the Fire HD 8 usually took just over 25 seconds to boot up. That’s slow, but still eight to 10 seconds faster than Walmart’s tablet on average. (For reference, an iPad Air M2 I had on hand took about 12 seconds to boot up.) Load times for individual apps were more of a toss-up: Some loaded a second or two faster on the Fire HD 8, some on the Onn, while others were effectively even. Ultimately, both let you do the basics without overwhelming trouble, but they always feel like they’re skirting the edge. I wouldn’t expect either to hold up well two or three years from now. One benefit of having a lower-spec device is that it won’t chew through battery life. Walmart says the Onn can last up to 15 hours, while Amazon rates the Fire HD 8 at up to 13 hours. Those are generous estimates, but both devices should last more than 10 or 11 hours on a charge with typical mixed use. The Onn survives a pinch longer between the two, but the difference is minimal. Both have enough juice to get you through a long flight. Both tablets also come with a paltry 32GB of storage, and the portion of that space that’s actually usable out of the box is even smaller: 25GB for the Fire HD 8 and just 18GB for the Onn. This means you likely won’t be able to install more than a few games to either device at any given time. Thankfully, you can add up to 1TB of room with a microSD card — a feature that is not available on any iPad — and that will be a must if you want to download a bunch of movies or songs to play offline. One caveat to all of this is that Amazon sells an upgraded version of the Fire HD 8 with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for $129. That puts it over the $100 threshold we set for this exercise, but the extra gig of memory should make everything run slightly smoother. The Walmart Onn 8&quot; tablet. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Good Android, bad Android The biggest distinction between the Onn and the Fire HD 8 comes down to their radically different takes on Android. With the former, it’s essentially a stock version of the OS. It’s Android 14, so it’s about to be two major updates behind, but the only app Walmart pre-installs is its own (natch) and even that is removable. Otherwise, all of Google’s core services are right there, swiping left on the home screen takes you to the Discover news feed and you can download just about any other app from the Play Store. If you’ve used an Android device in recent memory, you should be able to get around without a sweat. The tablet defaults to the Google Assistant out of the box, but you can download the company’s Gemini AI app and make that your default assistant in settings. While the chatbot isn’t as tightly integrated here as it is on Pixel devices , you can still use it to answer queries, summarize emails and webpages, generate text, create (terrible) images and so on. The Gemini 2.0 Flash model picks up voices well and runs without any serious lag to boot. For the most part, the Onn runs stock Android 14. Left to right: the home screen after installing and activating Google&#39;s Gemini AI bot, the personalized Google Discover news feed you see when you swipe left on the home screen and the front page of the Google Play Store. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Amazon, meanwhile, is still shipping its tablets with Fire OS, a heavily skinned fork of Android 11 with a custom app store and an extreme emphasis on the company’s own services. Years later, it remains obnoxious to the point of hostility. Omitting the Play Store means it doesn’t officially support any Google app, so there’s no Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Maps and the like. (While there is a YouTube “app,” it’s really just a dinky web shortcut.) Amazon’s own email and calendar apps are far less robust by comparison. Many of the major streaming and social media services are still available, but plenty of other big-name apps are not, including Reddit, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Slack, any browser besides Amazon’s extremely-basic Silk and tons of popular games. It’s still possible to install the Play Store onto a Fire tablet and sideload most of the apps you want from there, but setting that up is a pain and not every app will continue to work perfectly. More importantly, that’s not the experience Amazon is selling. Fire OS remains a platform that works best when you go behind its back. I can’t say that about stock Android. Much of Fire OS feels like it was explicitly designed to nickel-and-dime you, to sell you on everything Amazon. I’m not being hyperbolic: The first app you see upon unlocking the device is literally called “Shop Amazon,” and there’s a dedicated shortcut to the company’s storefront on the Silk browser’s home page. So many of the Amazon apps that come pre-loaded are based on a subscription — Kindle, Amazon Music, Amazon Photos, Audible, Freevee ( which no longer exists ), etc. — and almost none of them can be uninstalled. Swiping left from the home screen brings you to a “For You” page of content suggestions that constantly promotes those Amazon services and includes a row of sponsored apps toward the top of the page. The home screen itself has an unremovable “Discover” tab rife with similarly aimless suggestions and paid sponsorships. Most obnoxious are the lock screen ads. Every time you turn Fire HD 8 on, a full-screen ad for BetMGM, Verizon, a personalized Amazon listing or some other brand is there to greet you. Rarely do I feel like a gadget respects me less than when I see stuff like this. Sure, $100 isn’t a ton for a tablet, but it’s not nothing. When I see the same ad for my local Tri Honda Dealer for the 12th time that day, I can’t help but question who the actual product is. You can turn these ads off, but only if you pony up another $15 . A few snapshots from Amazon&#39;s Fire OS. Left to right: a lock screen ad for Verizon, the &quot;For You&quot; page of content suggestions and the home page of Amazon&#39;s custom app store. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Even if you do, it’s hard to shake the sense that Fire OS only really cares about getting you to funnel more cash into the Amazon machine. Google certainly pushes its own stuff too, but many of its services are proven and widely-used. Amazon’s platform is even louder with its self-promotion yet much more locked-down. In that sense, it isn’t consumer-friendly. People who really love Amazon apps could always just download them from the Play Store on any other Android tablet. No matter which platform you use, you’ll have to put up with the usual issue with Android on tablets: Many apps look like blown-up versions of the ones you’d see on phones more than experiences designed with a larger screen in mind. This is less of an issue on an 8-inch tablet than an 11-inch one, but any iPad will be better optimized for its size. I spent a long while ripping on Fire OS, but it does have some redeeming qualities. The Alexa voice assistant is baked into the device and runs quickly enough; if you have Alexa-compatible smart home devices, you can control them here hands-free. (At some point it should also work with the souped-up Alexa+ , though for now the Onn has the edge when it comes to AI support.) It’s good if you’re buying for a child too, as it lets you create a separate kid profile populated with age-appropriate apps, websites and videos. The Onn offers similar features through Google’s Kids Space mode, and both let you manage your child’s screen time and app library. But the Fire HD 8 makes those parental controls a bit easier to access, and it’s generally more proactive about locking down the rest of the device. You can also make it so your kid has to spend a set amount of time reading or using other educational material before they can play games. Looking forward, Amazon promises to supply the Fire HD 8 with security updates through 2029. It doesn’t mention anything about OS upgrades, but that’s still a decent level of support for the price. Walmart, on the other hand, hasn’t issued any software roadmap for Onn tablets, though we were able to apply a March security update earlier this month. We’ve reached out to the company for more details and will amend this review if we hear back. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Wrap-up After poring over the Fire HD 8 and Onn 8 for the past few weeks, my main takeaway has become clear: You should really try to pay for something better. Get an iPad , buy an older refurbished one if you have to, pay even a little bit extra for a more powerful tablet from Samsung , Lenovo or another name brand — it shouldn’t really matter. It’ll run better, both today and into the future. And any iPad will still make better use of its screen space. But that’s not an option for most people looking to buy one of these things. If you absolutely cannot spend more than $100, I’d wait for a sale on the Fire HD 8. Yes, I loathe much of what Fire OS represents, but you can at least paper over some of its annoyances by sideloading. The design is generally comfier to hold, and while its display is subpar, the Onn’s inability to stream many popular apps above 480p makes it almost impossible for me to recommend in 2025. If you want a cheap screen for some pet project that doesn’t involve streaming, the Onn may still work: Its display quality and aluminum finish are surprisingly decent for $79, and its version of Android is far less obnoxious than Fire OS. But that seems like a smaller niche. Both of these tablets serve to highlight just how much junk cash-strapped buyers are forced to eat simply for being on a budget. In the Fire tablet’s case, you have to let Amazon seed a miniature ad box in your home, one that promotes the company and its partners every single time you turn it on. In the Onn’s case, you get what feels like a lazy rebrand of a white-label device, one that the world’s richest retailer couldn’t bother to put through all of the necessary certification processes. I know what you’re thinking: “They’re cheap tablets, what do you expect?” And yeah, if you want the good stuff, you have to pay for it. More at 11. It’s just that we’ve been saying that for a long time now. These companies have lots of money. Maybe it’s time to expect a little better.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/33-immortals-preview-a-multiplayer-game-that-feels-great-to-play-solo-130029157.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Playing 33 Immortals for the first time is like going to a party at a coworker’s friend’s house. The first few minutes are marked by curiosity, light suspicion and a constant hum of awkwardness, but as you mingle, the strangers become less intimidating and you start to feel like you’re a part of the flow of the night. You might even make some friends of your own. The main difference is that, with 33 Immortals , you never have to take off your fuzzy slippers. I’m not kidding about flow when it comes to 33 Immortals . I fell into the game’s rhythm about 15 minutes into my three-hour preview, and by the end, I was shepherding small groups of lost souls across Inferno like I worked for Satan himself. In its simplest terms, 33 Immortals is like a multiplayer Hades , though its world is based on the lore of Dante’s Divine Comedy rather than Greek myth. Its vibe is also a tad more wholesome than Hades — maybe more crowd-pleasing, which makes sense considering the focus on large-scale multiplayer maps in 33 Immortals . I played the preview solo because I was feeling particularly antisocial that day, but of course that doesn’t mean I was alone. Other players occupy the hub world and the main maps in 33 Immortals , and though I initially tried to fade into the pixels and treat it as a single-player game, I quickly found myself emoting and seeking groups of warriors to join. With so many random players on the map at any time, it’s easy to feel like your small mistakes aren’t spotted, while your successes are clear for all to see, and even participate in. You start a run by picking a weapon — justice sword, sloth staff or greed daggers — and each has a special ability that only works when three players stand together and activate it. It’s different for each weapon, but the effect is consistently grand. I stuck with the Staff of Sloth, a weapon that flings purple balls of magic and whose special ability slows enemies across a large swath of the battlefield. In the heat of combat, with swarms of demons flooding the immediate area, it’s actually tricky to get three people to stand in the proper spots, but it takes just a moment of synchrony for the special ability to activate, and it’s a palpable relief every time. And then everyone immediately gets back to hurling spells, shooting arrows, flinging daggers and reviving allies, eyes peeled for the next special ability. Teamwork is an essential mechanic in 33 Immortals , and it’s not an intimidating one, even on an extra-introverted day. Amid all the chaos of combat, I never lost sight of my character for more than a split-second, and my dashes, interactions and attacks felt crisp and responsive. With dozens of enemies and allies on-screen at any given time, this alone is a notable achievement by developer Thunder Lotus. Thunder Lotus The game begins with a 33-player map, Inferno, which is an arid wasteland of roaming demons, 12 Torture Chambers and one big ascension battle to complete. The minions running around Inferno are easy enough to dispatch for practice and extra bones (the game’s currency), or you can run right by them without punishment. Torture Chambers are miniboss rooms designed for six players to tackle at once, but you can enter them with fewer than six, even alone. However, you’re unlikely to get far solo. The minibosses are hulking skeletons and big, flopping demon worms with plenty of health, and they always have hordes of minions as backup. Luckily, allies can join the chamber any time after a fight starts, up to six total, and no one can voluntarily leave until two swarms have been cleared. Each Torture Chamber rewards successful teams with two relic chests containing useful items and bones. One chest is always locked, requiring a key to spill its goods. You can carry up to eight relics at a time, buffing your stats in various ways, and you’re able to reroll chest items for a fairly low price. I had good luck defeating Torture Chambers with just three or four fighters total, but six was always welcome, hence my eventual shepherding. I also ended up prioritizing keys when shopping at the Bone Shrines scattered around Inferno because, dang it, I love unlocking chests. Once all of the Torture Chambers are defeated, holy fire spreads across Inferno, pushing players into one of three ascension spots designed for 11 fighters each. Here, enemies flood the fire-ringed circle and it’s a Thunderdome situation. If you live, you get a legendary relic and ascend alongside other surviving players to Inferno’s three-headed, bat-winged boss, Lucifer. This is where 33 Immortals ’ art style really shines: Lucifer is a big blue beast who feels ripped straight out of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe , and there are pleasant touches of 1980s cartoons all over the game. Thunder Lotus Though I battled Lucifer three times with varying team sizes, I never beat that first overworld. I’m eager to try again and unlock the next map, Purgatorio, which maxes out at 22 players. Like in Hades , 33 Immortals has a hub world, The Dark Woods, that players return to after each loop. This is where you’re able to apply upgrades, equip new weapons, alter your appearance and get some training in. I didn’t find any of the characters in the hub world particularly intriguing, but they serve their purpose just fine. Besides, it’s not about them — the main focus in 33 Immortals is all of the other actual people. As Engadget’s UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith prophesied in June 2023 , 33 Immortals only gets better with more players. 33 Immortals is available today in Early Access on Xbox Series X/S and PC (via the Xbox app and Epic Games Store ). It’s also included in Game Pass.

    "title": "It's about damn time Microsoft made an Xbox gaming handheld",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/its-about-damn-time-microsoft-made-an-xbox-gaming-handheld-130046591.html?src=rss",
    "description": "It hasn’t happened yet, but if rumors are to be believed , Microsoft may be finally working on an Xbox-branded gaming handheld. In a lot of ways, portable PCs represent a perfect evolution to the company’s consoles. But with Microsoft arriving late to the party, there are a few things this device needs to get right. Between Microsoft’s 20-plus year history making consoles and the Surface division’s expertise in engineering laptops and other mobile devices, you’d think creating a portable PC with a built-in screen and attached controllers would be as easy as sticking an AFK opponent with a ‘nade in Halo. And after the Steam Deck built a fort on Valve’s top sellers list since its release in 2022 , there’s an obvious financial incentive for Microsoft as well. Hell, we’ve even heard about how much Xbox CEO Phil Spencer likes traveling with his Legion Go , so it’s not like this is a foreign concept to the folks in Redmond. Regardless, aside from the Xbox-branded gaming laptop that we’ll probably never get (MSFT please?), a handheld console makes so much sense. The Nintendo Switch has already proven that there’s a massive appetite for a device you can easily connect to a TV but still take on the go. But more importantly, Spencer has been out there for years saying “I don’t want my team’s focus on console sales. The primary outcome of all the work that we do is how many players we see, and how often they play. That is what drives Xbox.” And right now, there’s no better way for the company to grow its user base than by making its first handheld console. Not only could a portable Xbox play games locally, it could also stream titles from the cloud (via Game Pass Ultimate), serve as another home for social features like the friends list, activity feed and so much more. According to Windows Central ’s Jez Corden , the device — codenamed Project Kennan — will feature a design similar to existing handhelds like the ROG Ally or Lenovo Legion Go (though it probably won’t have detachable controllers). While it appears Microsoft won’t be making the device itself, the company is said to be tapping ASUS (or possibly another OEM) to build it instead, which makes a lot of sense given the latter’s experience with the Ally and Ally X . From there, Microsoft is expected to add some “Xbox-y twists” like support for the Xbox Game Bar, Play Anywhere functionality and of course Game Pass Ultimate. Unfortunately, there isn’t concrete pricing or a specific release date, but it’s possible that this device could come out before the end of the year for between $499 and $599. But again, those numbers are mostly speculation, and there’s not much info regarding its screen size, processor or any other special features it might have. But let’s be real, the specs for this rumored portable Xbox aren’t all that important. Right now, there are a seemingly endless number of handhelds available from companies like ASUS , Lenovo , MSI , Ayaneo and GPD , with even more on the way. So if Microsoft comes out yet with another option that doesn’t address the flaws of current devices, it won’t make that big of an impact. That’s because, for my money, the Steam Deck still feels like the best portable gaming machine on the market. Sam Rutherford for Engadget While the Deck’s performance is often eclipsed by its Windows-based rivals, Valve’s machine offers a more polished and intuitive experience, thanks in large part to its purpose-built OS. When I use it, I don’t have to deal with annoying notifications or pop-ups that force me to awkwardly switch between various control schemes just to get into a game. On the Deck, I never have to use desktop apps (unless I want to), as Steam’s Big Picture mode (unlike Windows) was designed around a simple UI that can be navigated using joysticks instead of a mouse. The most important thing Microsoft can do for its upcoming handheld is to remove or sidestep the clunkiness you run into on practically every Windows-based device. This is something the company has tried to do before via improvements to the Windows Game Bar and may revisit again with its rumored Project Bayside , which could provide a standardized framework that would allow for a more streamlined UI. But what does this actually look like in the real world? When it’s all said and done, Microsoft’s goal should be to make it so that gamers can boot up the system, log in and install or launch a title without ever needing to move their hands away from the joysticks and face buttons. That means no shifting your fingers to tap a prompt on its touchscreen or needing to pull up a virtual keyboard/touchpad. And no add-on apps like ASUS’ Armoury Crate or Lenovo’s Legion Space, either. Those are simply Band-Aids that cover up the core issue of Windows 11 not being properly optimized for portable gaming PCs. If the company can do that, everything else will fall into place. Only then does it need to worry about specs and features. That said, I would like to see a portable Xbox include an OLED display with support for variable refresh rates that go up to either 120Hz or 144Hz. A microSD card slot is also a must, as it has become a standard component across gaming handhelds (especially as the size of AAA games continues to balloon). I’d also like to see Hall Effect sensors powering its joysticks (and triggers) for increased responsiveness and durability. A dock for connecting it to a TV or monitor would be a nice accessory too. And while it’s not an absolute necessity, I think some sort of built-in touchpad (or two, like on the Steam Deck), would go a long way toward making traditional mouse-and-keyboard games much more enjoyable on a handheld device. Honestly, the case for an Xbox handheld seems so obvious it’s kind of surprising Microsoft didn’t announce one years ago. Granted, it’s possible that the company has been waiting for the next version of its OS (i.e. Windows 12) to make a major concerted push on both traditional PCs and handhelds.

    "description": "The iPhone 17 Air (even the name is a rumor) is reportedly arriving this fall. As that Air suffix suggests, it could be Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever. However, while thin is all good, an arguably more intriguing change didn’t quite make it through the design process. In the latest Power On newsletter (we love a newsletter), Bloomberg ’s Mark Gurman said Apple had planned to ditch the USB-C port, making “Apple’s first completely port-free iPhone .” The notion was ditched in the face of more EU regulator issues, but it could appear in subsequent iPhones. Don’t worry, though, Apple has plenty of incoming phones to distract you. We’re expecting Apple to release another four iPhones this year, with the one currently nicknamed the iPhone 17 Air roughly 2 millimeters thinner than the rest. It could replace the Plus iPhone, with the family running from an entry-level iPhone 17 through to two higher-end Pro models. The new iPhone Air would nestle somewhere in the middle, for around $900. Rumors about the iPhone Air’s specs are still coalescing and shifting, but many reports suggest a single-camera system, the Dynamic Island and the Camera Control button. Alas, no iPhone mini.

NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Conference has kicked off, with CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote due in a few hours, at 1PM ET. Last year, NVIDIA used the event to unveil its Blackwell line of GPUs for faster and less demanding computations. We’re guessing Huang will introduce another iteration of Blackwell GPUs with even better specs. Many observers are looking for a strong showing, following the emergence of DeepSeek’s cheaper, lighter AI models, which shook up NVIDIA’s share price. Meanwhile, there have been many issues related to its latest RTX product launches — so will the company have a solution? Continue reading. The Pixel 9a has leaked so hard that YouTubers are reviewing it We don’t have our own review models yet. The Mobile Central At least two YouTubers have reviewed Google’s next entry-level Pixel phone. Both The Mobile Central and Sahil Karoul have Google’s new phone, confirming a lot of the stuff we knew about the Pixel 9a already. Seriously, there are few surprises — and at this point, it looks like leaking everything to do with its phones is part of Google’s PR strategy. Prove me wrong! After all that thin iPhone chat, the Pixel 9a doesn’t have Google’s trademark camera bump. Instead, the cameras are almost flush with the plastic back of the phone. The Pixel 9a also has a Google-made Tensor G4 chip, with a 48-megapixel wide and 13-megapixel ultrawide for photos and video. Continue reading. Boeing Starliner astronauts finally head home, nine months later The President and Elon Musk turned a routine mission into a political circus. Boeing Starliner’s mission — its first flight test with crew aboard — was supposed to take only eight days. However, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have, instead, spent the past nine and a half months aboard the International Space Station. Finally, they’re heading home, later today, according to NASA. We unravel why it took this long and what went wrong. Continue reading.

    "description": "InteraXon, the makers of the Muse wearable EEG , believe it’s made a big leap in scanning your brain’s health. It is launching the Muse S Athena, it’s fourth-generation device which adds a Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor. fNIRS is designed to track how much oxygen is in your brain, the levels of which vary depending on its activity. The company claims the sensor offers you the equivalent of a VO2 Max reading, but for your brain, aiding you on your journey to become mentally swole. If you’re unfamiliar, Muse has produced three wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices over the last decade. Put it on your forehead, close your eyes and, for instance, you’ll get audio feedback depending on what brainwaves your mind is pumping out. It’s useful for people who are learning meditation, since you’ll get the sound of birds chirping when your mental state is relaxed. The app offers targeted programs to help improve your relaxation, combat stress, improve focus and even keep an eye on how well you’re sleeping. Daniel Cooper for Engadget The Muse S Athena uses the same hardware-and-headband combination from the Muse S, which lets you wear it to sleep. Naturally, the biggest advancement here is the fNIRS sensor, paired with both the EEG and the company’s AI-driven foundational brain model. With it, you’ll get feedback on how much oxygen is flowing to your brain — a metric of how much mental effort you’re making at any given time. During meditation and relaxation exercises, you want that figure quite low, and when you’re trying to build up your focus and concentration, you want it to climb northward. Naturally, when worn to bed, you’ll get a record of your sleep stages, including how deep your sleep is. The company also promises that, if you use their audio cues to trigger sleep, you’ll also be able to use them to drift back to sleep if you wake up in the middle of the night. This is also the first Muse headband that can be used with the wearer’s eyes open, opening the door to a number of brain-training exercises. It’s hoped the hardware, combined with the skill games inside the app, will help improve people’s mental resilience. Not to mention, of course, helping older adults stave off cognitive decline by offering a chance to strengthen focus. The Muse S Athena is available to order today from the Muse website, priced at $474.99 in the US and $574.99 in Canada.

    "description": "Sony has apparently formed a new first-party studio for PlayStation called Dark Outlaw Games, and it has already started hiring personnel for it. Jason Blundell, who worked on several Call of Duty titles under Treyarch and who&#39;s perhaps best known for co-creating CoD&#39;s Zombies mode, has revealed that he&#39;s heading up the studio in an interview with Jeff Gerstmann for his podcast. As for why Sony Interactive hasn&#39;t announced the new studio yet, Blundell said that they&#39;ve been &quot;working away in the shadows for a while&quot; and that they&#39;ll &quot;step out into the light&quot; when they have something to talk about. Presumably, that means Sony will make an official announcement once Dark Outlaw is ready to reveal its first game. Blundell didn&#39;t say if he and his team have already started developing their first title or if it even already has a project lined up. All he said was that the studio is currently &quot;staffing up&quot; and that he&#39;s &quot;getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking right&quot; and then testing them.&nbsp; Blundell worked as a programmer and a producer for Activision before joining Treyarch to work on Call of Duty. For Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 , he directed and produced the Career and Zombies experiences. Blundell left Treyarch in 2020 and founded Deviation Games, which he also left in 2022 before the studio shut down two years later. According to Dark Outlaw Games&#39; LinkedIn account , the PlayStation studio was founded in 2024, is based in Los Angeles and has a team size between 11 and 50 persons.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-has-a-new-first-party-playstation-studio-led-by-cod-zombies-creator-jason-blundell-120007351.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The 17 best portable Bluetooth speakers for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Whether you&#39;re jamming out at the beach, setting up a backyard movie night or just want some tunes while you work, a great portable Bluetooth speaker is a must-have. The best options today go beyond just playing music — they deliver punchy bass, crisp vocals and even customizable sound modes to match whatever you&#39;re listening to. Some models even pack extras like a built-in LED light for a cool light show, making them perfect for parties or late-night hangs. The best portable Bluetooth speaker isn’t just about sound — it’s about convenience, too. Some speakers come in a tiny size that slips easily into a bag, while others have rugged, waterproof designs built for adventure. If you’re looking for a mini Bluetooth option for travel or a bigger speaker that fills a room with sound, there’s something out there for everyone. With so many choices, finding the best Bluetooth speaker for your needs can feel overwhelming. We’ve rounded up the top picks that balance great audio, portability and extra features to keep the music going wherever you are. Table of contents Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $50 to $200 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $200 to $450 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $450 and higher Factors to consider in a portable Bluetooth speaker Other portable Bluetooth speakers we tested Bluetooth speaker FAQs Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $50 to $200 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $200 to $450 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $450 and higher Factors to consider in a portable Bluetooth speaker Weather-proofing IP ratings (Ingress Protection) are the alphanumeric indicators you often see in a product’s spec sheet that define water and dust resistance. It’s usually a combo of two numbers with the first indicating solid object ingress and the second being water. The former goes from 0 (no protection) to 6 (dustproof). The water-resistance rating goes from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against immersion and high pressure jets). When an X is used instead of a number, that means the product wasn’t tested for resistance. If it’s a waterproof speaker, it may have some innate resistance to solids, but there’s no guarantee. IP67 is a common rating these days indicating highly resistant and potentially rugged speakers often featured in audio products like outdoor speakers. These are safe for quick dunks in the pool or tub and should be more than OK in the rain or in the shower. They’re also good options for the beach, playground and other rough environs. Additionally, speakers with ports and a high rating will often include a tight-fitting cover over the charging or auxiliary ports. If you plan on using the ports, that may limit the product&#39;s rated ability to fend off the elements. When looking for the best portable Bluetooth speaker, consider the IP rating and also how you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker when making your decision. It may be worth splurging on a better sounding model with a lower IP rating if you’ll mostly be using it indoors, for instance. Battery life The focus of this guide is on the best. portable Bluetooth speakers, and while “portable” can be a relative term, these devices are generally for people who are likely to find themselves far from a power outlet. These days, around 12 hours of playtime seems to be the baseline but obviously, the more battery life you can get out of a speaker, the better, especially if you plan to listen to podcasts or music on the go. That said, be careful when looking at battery specs, as they frequently list a maximum runtime (“up to” x amount of hours). This usually means they tested at a low to mid volume. If you like your tunes loud with punchy bass, it can often end up cutting the expected usage time in half or more. Luckily, some manufacturers also list the expected hours of battery life when used at full volume and that transparency is appreciated. Bear in mind, however, that not all of the best Bluetooth speakers use the same charging port. Some support USB-C charging, while others use micro-USB, and some may even come with an adapter for added convenience. Additionally, if your audio system or mini Bluetooth speaker also happens to have Wi-Fi connectivity, they&#39;re usually designed for always-on functionality. Unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that go to sleep after a short period without use, these will usually stay awake (to listen for your commands) and slowly run down the battery. If you&#39;re out and about, you&#39;ll want to remember to turn these speakers off manually when not in use to maximize battery life. Range Bluetooth 5 offers better range and more reliable connectivity than its predecessors, making it a great feature to look for in the best Bluetooth speaker. That said, Bluetooth range can still be tricky. Some companies list their product’s longest possible range, usually outdoors and in an unobstructed line-of-sight test environment. Other companies stick with a 30-foot range on the spec sheet and leave it at that, even though they may be running Bluetooth 4.x or 5.x. That’s likely underselling the speaker&#39;s potential, but unpredictable environments can affect range and there’s little point in promising the moon only to get complaints. I’ve seen signal drop issues when crouching down, with my phone in the front pocket of my jeans, and barely 30 feet away from a speaker inside my apartment. I ran into this issue across several devices regardless of their listed Bluetooth connectivity range. If you’re hosting a patio party and duck inside, it’s wise to keep any wireless Bluetooth speakers relatively close by just in case. It’s hard to gauge what aspects of any environment may interfere with a Bluetooth signal. In general, take range specs around 100 feet or more as a perfect-world scenario. Latency This is a minor mention for those out there who use a speaker for their computer output, or as a mini Bluetooth soundbar solution for setups like a monitor and streaming box. It’s annoying to find that your speaker’s latency isn’t low enough to avoid lip sync issues. Luckily, it seems that most speakers these days don’t often have these problems. Only a handful of the few dozen speakers I tried had persistent, noticeable lip-sync issues. Aside from occasional blips, all of our picks worked well in this regard. If you plan to frequently use a speaker for video playback, look for devices with the most recent Bluetooth 5 technology and lower latency codecs like aptX. Also make sure the speaker is close to the source device as distance can be a factor. To avoid the issue altogether, though, consider getting one with a wired auxiliary input. Extra features Some speakers don’t just play music — they bring the party to life with built-in LED light effects and a full-on light show that syncs to your music. If you love a bit of visual flair with your tunes, it’s worth checking out models that offer LED light customization options. Sound quality also plays a huge role in picking the right speaker. The best Bluetooth speaker should deliver a balanced mix of punchy bass, clear highs and strong vocals. Many models also include customizable sound modes that let you tweak the EQ to better suit different genres — whether you’re blasting EDM, listening to a podcast, or just want a more immersive experience. If aesthetics matter, many models come in a tiny size that makes them extra portable, with plenty of color options to match your personal style. Whether you want a sleek black speaker or a vibrant eye-catching design, there are plenty of choices to fit your vibe. Other portable Bluetooth speakers we tested Sonos Roam While there&#39;s a lot to like about the Sonos Roam , there are plenty of other Bluetooth speakers with more features and better battery life. In our review , we gave the Roam a score of 87, praising it for its good sound quality, durable waterproof design and ability to work well within an existing Sonos speaker ecosystem. But the price is just fine at $180, and we found Bluetooth speakers that offer more at lower price points. Plus, the Roam taps out at 10 hours of battery life, and all of our top picks can run for longer than that on a single charge. Monoprice Soundstage3 The Monoprice Soundstage3 offers relatively big sound at a midrange $250 price, with a variety of inputs rarely found on a portable Bluetooth speaker. The boxy, minimalist design is no nonsense, even if it&#39;s more of a less-rugged, bookshelf-styled homebody. While the speaker puts out crisp highs alongside booming lows, we found the bass can overpower the rest of the output, so it&#39;s not for everyone. And after using the speaker for many months, we also found the low-slung, poorly labeled button panel along the top can be a bit annoying to use. If you want a speaker for road trips, favor mids and highs, and plan on using physical buttons for volume control and input selections, there are better options out there. JBL Boombox 3 Fans of JBL’s bluetooth speaker sound profile who want to crank up the volume, but also want a rugged and portable option, may enjoy the JBL Boombox 3 . It’s a decent grab-and-go speaker with a very loud output, although it&#39;s not as good as some of the loud-speaker styled options for long-throw sound and big outdoor areas. However, the price for this speaker line remains prohibitively expensive compared to other options with big sound that cover a bit more ground. If the JBL brand is your thing and you like the rugged, portable form factor, we recommend looking for discounts, or shopping around and exploring the available options including the (less portable) JBL PartyBox series. Soundcore Motion X500 Soundcore speakers have generally been good and often reasonably priced. The Motion X500 loosely falls into that category. It has a tall, metallic lunchbox vibe with a fixed handle and pumps out a respectable 40 watts of crisp, clear sound for its size. It can get pretty loud and serves up a good dose of bass, although its primarily a front-facing speaker. There’s LDAC hi-res audio support for Android users, but the main selling point on this is spatial audio. This is done through an EQ change and the activation of a small, up-firing driver. There’s a slight benefit from this if you’re up close and directly in front of it, but it’s not a total game changer for your listening experience. The original pre-order price of $130 made it a decent option in terms of bang for your buck. But it went up to $170 at launch, making it less appealing even if it’s still a good middle-of-the-road option if you want small-ish, clear and loud. If you can find one on sale for the lower price , it’s definitely worth considering. There’s also the larger and louder X600 ($200) if the overall concept is working for you. Portable Bluetooth speaker FAQs How does a Bluetooth speaker work? Bluetooth technology lets devices connect and exchange data over short distances using ultra high frequency (UHF) radio waves. It’s the frequency range that’s carved out for industrial, scientific and medical purposes, called the 2.4GHz ISM spectrum band. This range is available worldwide, making it easy for companies to use with devices for global markets. Bluetooth speakers include this tech, which lets them communicate with source devices like smartphones, tablets or computers in order to exchange data. The two devices pair by sharing a unique code and will work within the proscribed range for the device and Bluetooth version.&nbsp; Ever since Bluetooth 4.0 was released over a decade ago, new iterations usually improve on range, use less power and offer expanded connectivity with features like multipoint (allowing more than one device to be connected at the same time, for instance). Who should buy a Portable Bluetooth speaker? If you want to play music while you’re out-and-about on something other than headphones, a portable Bluetooth speaker is probably what you want. There’s a broad range of devices for all types of circumstances. Many adventurous people will want a relatively lightweight portable that’s rugged enough to handle the elements while also packing enough charge to play for hours on end. Others may simply need a speaker they can move around the house or use in the backyard. In this case, you can choose larger less rugged models that may offer better sound.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Families of Tesla crash victims are worried that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will weaken oversight of autonomous vehicles. | Image: Getty Family members of people who died in Tesla crashes are urging the US Department of Transportation not to scrap a Biden-era rule requiring companies to report crashes that involve fully or partially autonomous vehicles. They also say they are worried that Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s influence in the Trump administration may lead the department to weaken oversight of his company. In a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, seven families say they are “deeply concerned” that the federal government would water down oversight of driver assist technology like Tesla’s Autopilot.&nbsp; “We fear this important measure is under threat given recent media reports and the influence of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose company operates the most widely used Level 2 ADAS systems in America,” the letter, which was first reported by Politico , reads. Their fears aren’t unwarranted. Before the inauguration, Reuters reported that Trump’s transition team was discussing eliminating a standing general order issued under Biden requiring automakers and tech companies to report crashes involving autonomous vehicles as well as Level 2 driver-assist systems. Scrapping the rule would greatly benefit Tesla, which to date, has reported the most number of crashes . Tesla Victims Letter to Secretary of Transportatio by ahawkins8223 on Scribd In urging him not to eliminate the rule, the family members appeal to Duffy’s own experience with vehicular violence, referencing the head-on collision that almost killed his wife, Rachel.&nbsp; “Just as your family has experienced the life-shattering consequences of a preventable motor vehicle collision, we’ve had our own devastating experiences, all of which were caused by Tesla’s autonomous driving technology being released onto the roadways without the necessary safeguards,” they write. Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, which are considered Level 2 systems that require drivers to pay attention, are both covered under the rule. Since it was implemented, Tesla has reported over 1,800 crashes to the federal government. An analysis of the crash data shows Tesla accounted for 40 out of 45 fatal crashes reported to NHTSA through October 2024. The families note that the data reporting rule has led to important regulatory decisions, like the December 2023 recall of over 2 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot. The recall wasn’t a physical recall, but rather an over-the-air software update meant to address issues around driver inattention and Tesla’s warning systems , which NHTSA said has contributed to hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths . NHTSA later launched a probe into whether Tesla’s software fix was sufficient to address the defect. The families urge Duffy to keep the rule in place and ensure “active investigations into Tesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving continue free from improper influence.” During his confirmation hearing, Duffy was asked by Senate Democrats whether he would allow safety investigations into Tesla’s advanced driving technology to proceed, given Musk’s status as a major donor and special advisor to Trump. Duffy said he would “commit… that I will let NHTSA do their investigation.”",

    "description": "Google’s brand new midrange phone, the Pixel 9A , won’t be shipping until sometime in April. That’s not strange in and of itself, but it turns out you can’t even preorder one from the Google Store yet. The latter situation is fairly unusual, as Google normally starts taking orders for new hardware right after announcing it. There’s a reason for this vague release timeframe: Google initially wanted to get the Pixel 9A out the door in March, but it’s been held back for some last-minute quality checks. &#8220;We&#8217;re checking on a component quality issue that&#8217;s affecting a small number of Pixel 9A devices,” Google spokesperson Matt Flegal told The Verge by email. Review units of the new phone haven’t yet been distributed to media, which is another indication that Google discovered something worth investigating at the eleventh hour. We’ve asked Google if it can specify which component is at issue here. Earlier this year, the company issued an urgent firmware update for the long-discontinued Pixel 4A to address battery overheating concerns . (The 5,100mAh battery in the Pixel 9A is the largest of any Google phone to date.) Google has also had to extended warranty coverage for display defects on the Pixel 8. But otherwise, aside from earlier Tensor chips running uncomfortably warm at times, the Pixel lineup has a decent track record when it comes to hardware reliability. Whatever the problem might be, it’s reassuring to see Google playing it safe here. Pixel 9A buyers will just have to wait a bit longer than they might’ve hoped to say goodbye to the camera bump.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/632523/microsoft-copilot-uninstall-bug-fix",
    "description": "Copilot is coming back after Microsoft accidentally uninstalled it from some Windows 11 devices. In an update to its support page , Microsoft said affected devices “are being returned to their original state,” ending what some may have considered a brief respite from the AI assistant. On Monday, Microsoft said it was aware of a bug that uninstalled Copilot and unpinned it from the taskbar following its March 11th update. While it worked on a fix, Microsoft suggested reinstalling Copilot from the Microsoft Store and manually pinning it to the taskbar. Microsoft began rolling out Copilot as a native Windows app earlier this month, adding a sleeker UI and the ability to quickly start a voice chat with Copilot by holding down the Alt + Spacebar keys. Microsoft is also aware of a bug where users on Arm-powered devices aren’t able to download Roblox from the Microsoft Store. It says Roblox is working on a fix, and that users can download the game directly from Roblox.com instead.",

    "description": "When AI giant OpenAI submitted its &acirc;&#128;&#156;freedom-focused&acirc;&#128;&#157; policy proposal to the White House&acirc;&#128;&#153;s AI Action Plan last Thursday, it gave the Trump administration an industry wishlist: use trade laws to export American AI dominance against the looming threat of China, loosen copyright restrictions for training data (also to fight China), invest untold billions in AI infrastructure (again: China), and stop states from smothering it with hundreds of new laws. But specifically, one law: SB 1047, California&acirc;&#128;&#153;s sweeping, controversial, and for now, defeated AI safety bill. Hundreds of AI-related bills are flooding state governments nationwide, and hundreds or even thousands are expected by the end of 2025, a regulatory deluge the AI industry is trying to dodge. Broad safety regulations like SB 1047 are particularly threatening, posing a perhaps existential threat to OpenAI.

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/632516/nvidia-rtx-50-series-price-cuts-europe-currency-changes",
    "description": "Nvidia has cut prices on its RTX 50-series of GPUs across Europe this week. The price cuts are thanks to a stronger Euro against the dollar, allowing Nvidia to cut the price of some of its latest GPUs by nearly five percent due to better exchange rates. Videocardz reports that the RTX 5090 has dropped by more than four percent to €2,229, down €100 from the €2,329 launch pricing. The RTX 5080 has also dropped by €50 to €1,119, and the RTX 5070 is now €619 instead of €649. The only RTX 50-series card that hasn’t dropped in price is the RTX 5070 Ti, which Nvidia didn’t make a Founders Edition of, so it remains at €879. Prices in the UK have also benefited from the weaker dollar, with the RTX 5090 currently priced at £1,889 instead of its £1,939 launch pricing. While prices have dropped, stocks haven’t improved so it’s still difficult to purchase an RTX 50-series card across Europe at these adjusted retail prices. Nvidia claimed earlier this month that it has sold more RTX 50-series GPUs than 40-series during the first five weeks of launch. The claim is slightly misleading though, because the RTX 4090 was the only RTX 40-series card available for more than a month during its launch period in 2022.",

    "description": "The Kindle Colorsoft is ideal for reading comic books and manga. | Photo: Andrew Liszewski / The Verge When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &nbsp; The best Kindle (2024) deals The best Kindle Kids (2024) deals The best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals The best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals The best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals The best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe , Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper. Below, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price. The best Kindle (2024) deals What does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”? Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads. In case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model . The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage. In the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the Kindle at Amazon , Best Buy , and Target for its full retail price of $109.99.&nbsp; The best Kindle Kids (2024) deals Amazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99. In terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. This last is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost. In the past, we’ve seen the new Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only buy the e-reader at its full price of $129.99 at Amazon , Best Buy , and Target . The best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals The latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model . Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. That being said, it’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life. Like other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations. There’s an ad-free Signature Edition for $199.99, which is identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. There’s also a Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 , which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. In the past, we’ve seen the Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Unfortunately, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon , Best Buy , and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can also grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and a black , green , or pink fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off) or with a plant-based black , green , or pink leather cover for $202.97 ($20 off). Read our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review . As for the ad-free Signature Edition, it’s available at Amazon and Best Buy right now for $199.99 — its regular retail price. You can also grab it at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black , green , or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off) or with a plant-based black , green , or pink leather cover for $257.97 ($25 off). The best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals Amazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers parental controls you can turn off. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. We recently saw the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids fall to an all-time low of $139.99 ($40 off); however, at the moment, you can only pick it up at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $179.99 (its full retail price). The best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals Like its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300 dpi, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles have become known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting. Recently, we saw the entry-level Kindle Scribe drop to an all-time low of $324.99 ($75 off). However, right now, you can only buy the base model at Amazon &nbsp;and&nbsp; Best Buy for its full retail price of $399.99. That said, right now Amazon is offering a $40 discount when you buy two Kindle Scribes. You can also save money if you purchase the base Scribe as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $434.97 ($55 off) or a premium leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off) . Alternatively, the 64GB version is available with the same accessories and a plant-based leather cover for $479.97 ($60 off) or a premium leather cover for $504.97 ($65 off) . Read our Kindle Scribe (2024) review . The best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals In October, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the&nbsp;Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga. We recently saw the Kindle Colorsoft drop to $229.99 ($50 off) for Prime members, which is the first discount we’ve seen on the color ebook reader to date. Unfortunately, that deal has expired, meaning you can only buy the standalone model at&nbsp; Amazon &nbsp;and&nbsp; Best Buy &nbsp;for its full retail price of $279.99. However, you can save some money if you buy it as a part of a bundle for $327.97 ($35 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black , pink , or green . You can also buy it with a “premium” leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off). Read our Kindle Colorsoft review .",

    "description": "After 11 years, Boston Dynamics has said goodbye to its humanoid robot Atlas &mdash; but only the hydraulic version. In a video posted on YouTube , the robotics company says it&rsquo;s time for Atlas to &ldquo;kick back and relax&rdquo; in retirement, letting the new all-electric Atlas take the reins . Boston Dynamics revealed Atlas in 2013 as part of a contest for the Department of Defense. In its very first iteration, Atlas stood six feet, two inches tall and weighed 330 pounds. As Boston Dynamics continued to tweak Atlas&rsquo; design over the years, we&rsquo;ve seen the robot hop, jump, and twirl across a mat and toss around tool bags . The new Atlas comes with a big design change. Not only is it all-electric but it&rsquo;s also outfitted with a ring light on its rounded head, along with rotating body parts that allow for improved agility and dexterity. Hopefully, this new bot will have similarly impressive dance moves to its predecessor. Here&rsquo;s a recap of Atlas&rsquo; entire history at Boston Dynamics.

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/632121/razer-wyvrn-developer-ai-qa-gamer-copilot-sensa-haptics-thx",
    "description": "Razer is getting into AI with a new developer platform called Wyvrn . It encompasses dev-focused automation tools like the Razer AI QA Copilot to assist with quality assurance / game testing and the AI Gamer Copilot (formerly called Project Ava ) for real-time tips and guides via voice assistant while playing games. Wyvrn (pronounced “wyvern,” like the mythical creature) will also be an umbrella for Razer’s next-gen Chroma RGB platform, a new THX Spatial Audio Plus game plug-in, and Razer’s Sensa HD Haptics software. The most consequential of Razer’s new tools is the AI QA Copilot. It’s a cloud-based plug-in for Unreal Engine, Unity, and bespoke engines in C++ that’s designed to reduce the time and cost of manual quality assurance testing through AI. Quality assurance is a labor-intensive process for any video game, involving many hours of testing and manually logging glitches in need of fixing. The AI assistant can watch a game being tested, automatically find bugs or performance issues like frame rate drops, and create a QA playtest report with both its findings and any bugs manually tagged by the tester. Razer claims that its AI can identify 20 to 25 percent more bugs compared to manual testing, and this can reduce QA time by up to 50 percent as well as cost savings of up to 40 percent. After playtest reports are generated, the AI QA Copilot is designed to learn from the tagged bugs to get “smarter” and more effective. What will happen to the employee headcount in QA teams if these tools are introduced and proven successful? It’s perhaps not difficult to imagine . And Razer is already partnering with game dev services company Side (formerly PTW ) to integrate the AI QA Copilot into its in-house QA teams. The other big component of Razer’s dabbling in AI is its upcoming and very uniquely named AI Gamer Copilot. It’s an AI-based voice assistant that’s designed to watch you play and give you live, on-the-fly tips for tactics in competitive multiplayer games like MOBAs or strategies on how to take down difficult enemies in single-player games like Black Myth: Wukong . My colleague Sean Hollister and I saw a brief demo of this at CES while it was called Project Ava, and it seemed… interesting . The retiring of its “project” moniker means it’s destined for an actual release. Razer’s other, non-AI announcements pegged under the Wyvrn platform include its Razer Sensa HD Haptics, which is now getting a sim racing game integration in partnership with SimHub . That means users of its Freyja haptic chair cushion and Kraken V4 Pro headset can get multidirectional, multidevice haptic feedback in games like Assetto Corsa Evo . Razer claims Sensa haptics are now in over 100 supported titles, with the promise of more to come. And lastly, Razer is introducing a THX Spatial Audio Plus plug-in for Wwise. It’s an open-source format alternative to Dolby and DTS, offering more immersive 3D audio in games.",

The company says it offers “the same trusted, distraction-free experience” as it does on other platforms. It&#8217;s also free to use, and won’t count against the free plan’s one-device syncing limit, for now. One of the more popular journaling apps, Day One has only been available as a web app and on iOS, macOS, and Android, so far. As for how long the new Windows version doesn’t count against your syncing device limit, the Microsoft Store listing doesn’t specify for how long, beyond its “limited launch period.” We’ve asked Automattic if it can be more specific and will update if it shares that info. From the video above, the Windows Day One app will be familiar, especially if you’ve used the Mac or web version. Like on other platforms, you get unlimited text entries to which you can add multimedia and search tags. Entries are stored locally and use end-to-end encryption for cloud backups. The app also offers “daily prompts and inspiration” to help get you going. Day One requires a subscription to its Premium plan for things like keeping multiple journals, adding videos or voice recordings to entries, or using the app’s built-in voice dictation. You can see the full list on its website . Day One’s announcement says it’s planning future AI features such as “context-aware” journaling prompts and AI-summaries of your past journal entries.",

    "title": "The weeklong TikTok fight over whether NYC influencers are ‘boring’",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/632040/nyc-influencers-boring-tiktok-algorithms",
    "description": "TikTok’s curse or blessing, depending on how you look at it, is that any video made by any random person can get millions of views without much rhyme or reason. Thousands of comments flood in, people make reaction videos, your random thoughts are referenced as gospel, and the TikTok content machine starts to whir. If you’re of a certain demographic with certain interests — namely lifestyle, beauty, fashion, and New York City — you’ve probably already seen this viral 43-second clip that has spiraled into a full-blown Discourse Cycle. Earlier this month, a TikTok user, who had 90 followers at the time, posted a video that cut right to the chase: “All right guys, I’m just going to say it: I hate all of the New York influencers. I think they’re boring as fuck, and I think they’re all carbon copies of one another,” the creator, @martinifeeny, says. The biggest influencers based in New York wear and buy the same things, she goes on to say, and they’re all thin and pretty but boring. In the comments, people called out the specific boutique fitness classes and skincare routines that appear to form the lion’s share of the influencers’ hobbies; some made the point that following a more diverse set of influencers would solve the problem entirely. Some influencers — apparently feeling personally attacked — made (and deleted) videos responding to the original one. @martinifeeny Im SOOO bored by all these influencers lol #nycinfluencers #imo #nyc #tiktokgirls #bored ♬ original sound &#8211; MartiniFeeny You do not need to know the specific influencers enmeshed in the discussion ( though Vulture has a good run down ), live in New York, or even follow influencers to get the point. Social media is awash in people who look, sound, and act like their peers, often for money. This “drama” is narrowly focused on one type of person, but it is a microcosm of the internet writ large: the most visible content online is just a slightly different version of something else. In November, I wrote a story that might be the galaxy-brain version of the “influencers are boring” discourse — the saga of two young women so similar to one another that there’s a legal battle being waged to try and figure out if one of them broke the law . The two influencers are not based in New York, but if they were, they might be wrapped up in the current TikTok firestorm. In lay terms, their content style is best described as “basic.” They almost exclusively promote products purchased on Amazon, which itself lacks any substance and style so it can appeal to the widest customer base possible. The lawsuit claims that one influencer copied another’s very standard look so closely that she infringed on the plaintiff’s copyright and trade dress. There’s a lot to be said about how and why certain people are elevated to bona fide capital-I Influencer status. Some of it has to do with who you are — your race, class, gender, disability status, and other aspects can push your career along or make it more difficult to ascend . The “New York City” designation is mostly a branding exercise. As other content creators have pointed out , the biggest influencers based in the city do not engage with their surroundings beyond going to restaurants, bars, and shopping. The city is a backdrop for selling their audiences clothing, home decor, makeup, and other consumables. Many of the women in this archetype are clients of the same talent manager who helps them secure sponsored content deals and advertising campaigns with a roster of brands. As I detailed in my story about the Amazon influencers, the platforms these content creators have hitched their wagons to demand replicability; the algorithms reward palatable and ideologically neutral content that fits into established genres. It is easier to make videos that look like those of your peers than it is to create an entirely new format. As an influencer, you are making content that must be understandable to recommendation systems , and if the number goes up when you make boring videos, then that’s all the signal you need to keep doing the same thing over and over. If it feels like everyone is the same, it’s because they are all milking the same formula that social media platforms tell them is working. It’s like the MrBeast YouTube thumbnail strategy , but for women in their 20s, whose brand revolves around them posting videos from the West Village. Our digital feeds will continue to get more monotonous, not less Platforms pushing user behavior (and creativity) toward a dull average has become a defining characteristic of the current state of the internet. Before you notice the repetition on TikTok, you’re more likely to see this same thing happen with websites you visit — there’s a reason all recipe sites look the same, why every article you click on suddenly has subheads and author bios . In this example, it’s Google setting the conditions for engagement, and a captive audience of SEO workers who jump through hoops to make sure their sites are visible in search. When your life depends on people seeing and engaging with your article, TikTok video, Instagram Reel, there’s little reason to stray from what catches on, and often what travels the most is painfully, mind-numbingly average. The fact that technology companies promise the next frontier of human creation is AI — which are, by definition, average generators — suggests that our digital feeds will continue to get more monotonous, not less. Is it any surprise then that this crop of New York women building influencer careers and businesses all seem the same? It’s not necessarily that they, as people, are indistinguishable. But they are hired by the same brands to produce the same videos to appeal to the same potential customers, and this cycle repeats until someone new but similarly fitting comes along and shifts the goalposts slightly. Ultimately, this debate over carbon copy influencers fundamentally misunderstands two things. One is what these influencers are doing when they post.

    "description": "四川大学的研究人员调查了屏幕时间与心血管病风险的关系。研究人员从中国健康与营养调查（CHNS）中选取了 7124 名参与者。CHNS 是一项始于 1989 年的大规模纵向研究，采用多阶段随机整群抽样设计，覆盖中国多个省份，旨在研究社会经济、行为变化以及饮食、身体活动与健康结果之间的关系。在本研究中，参与者需提供 2009 年的血脂数据，并在 2011 - 2015 年间至少有一次随访记录。研究人员通过面对面问卷调查收集参与者休闲时间的每日屏幕暴露信息，涵盖看电视、玩电子游戏、上网聊天等多种屏幕活动，并计算工作日和周末的平均屏幕暴露时长。研究发现，每日屏幕时间每增加 1 小时，血液总胆固醇 TC、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）和载脂蛋白 B（ApoB）水平分别升高 0.34%、0.47% 和 0.51%，但屏幕时间与其他血脂生物标志物无显著关联。其中血液 LDL-C 和 ApoB 水平的升高与动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病发病风险增加显著相关。",

    "description": "自 3 月 2 日成为首个成功软着陆月球的民间登月探测器后，「蓝色幽灵（Blue Ghost）」在预计的两周任务期间内持续传回许多令人惊叹的纪录。3 月 14 日在美洲地区发生一场月全食，但是在月球上看起来则是地球挡住了太阳光，是日全食。蓝色幽灵恰好见证了这场罕见的「日全食」并记录下精彩影像，这也是第一次由商业公司在月球运作时观测到日全食。日食持续将近 5 小时，在蓝色幽灵降落点的危海包括了约 2 小时 16 分的全食期。地球上月全食也被称为血月，这是由于当地球运行到太阳与月球之间时，月球将完全笼罩在地球的阴影中并呈现红色。相较之下，蓝色幽灵拍摄到的照片显现出地球挡住太阳并出现红色的光环。虽然光环类似于地球上观测到的日环食，但是从月球上看地球的直径远大于太阳，因此不可能会发生日环食。这个光环是由于地球大气层折射的结果，环上的亮纹与暗纹则是大气中天气变化的影响。",

    "description": "A Ukrainian sniper practices in the Kharkiv region. Photo by Liubov Yemets/Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images A Ukrainian sniper described how he made the jump from a hunting rifle to a US-made Barrett MRAD sniper rifle. He told BI that the US-made Barrett had a positive effect on operations. He said that the Barrett was more accurate than the hunting rifle with which he started the war. A Ukrainian Special Operations Forces sniper told Business Insider that it made a huge difference in battle when he traded out his civilian hunting rifle for a US-made Barrett MRAD , a weapon the US military embraced years ago for its versatility. The sniper said that he only used his hunting rifle for a short period in the fall of 2023 before upgrading to the Barrett sniper rifle. Harley is a Ranger in Ukraine&#39;s Special Operations Forces 4th Regiment. He told BI through a translator that when Russia launched its full-scale invasion, he went to war with his hunting rifle from US gunmaker Savage Arms. Then he got his hands on the MRAD, or Multi-role Adaptaptive Design, rifle from Barrett Firearms. Both guns are bolt-action rifles, but Harley described the Savage as a civilian rifle, not a military one. By contrast, the Barrett rifle was created specifically to meet the requirements of a US Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, sniper rifle program. Different US service branches have picked up the rifle over the years. The weapon is also used by other militaries, including Ukraine. A US Army Green Beret does sniper training with a Barrett MRAD rifle in Bulgaria. US Army photo taken by Sgt. Alejandro Lucero Harley said that he received the MRAD chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum. The interesting thing about the MRAD, though, is that it can be chambered in different calibers. The sniper said he could change out the barrel in training, using cheaper, more readily available .308 ammunition . He said it gives him greater flexibility. Different calibers support different mission sets, so the ability to change the barrel and caliber of the rifle out in the field is exceptionally advantageous. The US Army has described this rifle as &#34;a multi-caliber, bolt-action sniper rifle, which is effective against personnel and material targets at extreme ranges.&#34; Harley also praised the Barrett for having a more accurate barrel than the Savage. &#34;I can say that the rifle is very good,&#34; Harley said of the Barrett. He could not disclose whether he&#39;s had any confirmed kills as a sniper. A Ukrainian soldier holds a Savage 110 sniper rifle in the Kharkiv region on March 18. Photo by Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images Harley stressed that it&#39;s not just the weapon that matters in combat. The attachments can make a difference in effectiveness. He can outfit his MRAD rifle with add-ons like thermal imaging attachments, night vision sights, and laser guidance to give him an edge in battle. &#34;The rifle itself will do nothing without a sight, without a night vision device, without a night observation device,&#34; he said. The Barrett attachments allow him to work during the day and night. A sniper has a unique ability to send precision fire down range for a kill, typically from concealed positions, but they often support operations in other ways, such as targeting and overwatch. The rifle is a valuable tool in those missions, even if a shot is never fired. Harley described how he could find a Russian target and highlight it for a fellow soldier operating a Mk 19 grenade launcher, who could then drop a high-explosive round on the Russian target. In other words, the Barrett shouldn&#39;t be viewed as just an individual weapon but rather part of a bigger system of capabilities. Harley used the Barrett for a year until last fall, when he became an instructor. During his years in active combat operations, he was sent to different sectors of the front line.

    "title": "I went to the hot NYC coworking space that's become a hub for Gen Z founders building new apps",

    "description": "Verci is a social club and coworking space in New York City. Sydney Bradley Verci, a members-only coworking space and social club, has become a hub for consumer startups. Over a dozen consumer tech companies are working out of the NYC coworking space. I went to the location in Flatiron to see what it&#39;s like to work there. There&#39;s a TikToker on the couch, startup founders are &#34;locked in&#34; at their desks, and the sun is beaming in on the top floor of a Manhattan office space with a view of the Empire State Building. It&#39;s an ordinary Friday afternoon at Verci, a members-only coworking and social space that describes itself as a &#34;second home for the creative and curious in New York.&#34; Verci has become a home base for more than a dozen consumer-focused startups building AI and social apps. The space is a hub within a hub, as New York City has also become a hot spot for the category. &#34;I see more and more companies coming to New York,&#34; Michael Giardino, CEO of AI consumer app startup Oleve, told Business Insider. Verci was founded in 2022 by Ami Yoshimura (23) and Anant Vasudevan (25), who, like many other Gen Zers, were seeking community and in-person connection. The two came together to build a space with the feeling of a college campus for &#34;people who are a bit more unconventional,&#34; Yoshimura said. Verci founders Ami Yoshimura (in purple) and Anant Vasudevan (in green) set up for an event. Sydney Bradley After hosting pop-up spaces, Verci signed its first lease in 2023 and recently moved into a four-year lease for a two-floor space in the Flatiron District. It&#39;s not the first social club to occupy the address. Scattered across Verci are archeological remains of the now-defunct coworking and social club for women: The Wing . Branded plates are still in the kitchen, and wall tiles with The Wing&#39;s &#34;W&#34; logo are still on display. Remains of The Wing are all over Verci in Flatiron. Sydney Bradley The top floor, the more social floor where community events are held, is fully stocked with a kitchen, disco ball, and corner with flowy drapes that is converted to a tea room on Tuesdays and a presentation spot on Friday evenings. One floor below is Verci Satellite, the business&#39;s coworking arm, where startups like IRL-social company&nbsp; 222 , social mood board app Housewarming (formerly Verse), and fintech startup Debbie are building consumer-focused apps. &#34;It&#39;s a good cure for winter depression,&#34; said Zibo Gao, cofounder of music app Soundmap (a sort of Pokémon Go for discovering new music), who told me he comes in four to five days a week. In a bathroom on the startup floor is a sign that says: Employees LLM Users must wash hands before returning to work. There&#39;s even a full rooftop deck with a panoramic view of skyscrapers. Sydney Bradley Currently, Verci has a little under 300 members and accepts 25 to 50 new members in each cohort, many of whom are either in their 20s or early 30s. Verci memberships have different priced tiers that start at $1,200 per year to access community events (and only have access to the space on Fridays). The more involved tiers include 24/7 access to the Flatiron space, and the Satellite tier starts at $600 dollars per month for desk space and startup resources. The private offices on the Satellite floor can cost startups thousands per month, Yoshimura added. It&#39;s about on par with other boutique coworking spaces in New York, but slightly cheaper than a membership to New York&#39;s Soho House (though Soho House&#39;s under-27 membership is a similar annual price to Verci&#39;s) or Neuehouse. A hub for consumer startups As I&#39;m walking around getting the full tour of the new Verci location, I run into several startup founders that I&#39;ve written about for BI. One of 222&#39;s cofounders walks by, and I also spot Zehra Naqvi, an angel investor and founder of AI social search startup Lore, on a call in a phone booth. Sydney Bradley &#34;Whenever I come here, I first check to see which of the other consumer founders I know that are in,&#34; Naqvi said about her everyday Verci routine. Naqvi and several other startup founders on the floor told me there&#39;s a strong collaborative energy at Verci. If you have a question that needs an answer, someone will have one, or they&#39;ll know someone else who does. Oleve&#39;s Giardino told me working at Verci feels similar to the startup accelerator experience (Oleve&#39;s team was in the Neo accelerator in 2023). In total, there are 19 consumer startups working out of Verci, 14 of which have raised venture capital, Yoshimura said. At least two of the startups have gone through Y Combinator . Vasudevan said some startups are even recruiting talent &mdash; either to hire or partner with, like creators &mdash; just by going upstairs. Upstairs that same day was Max Zavidow, a comedy creator with over 1 million TikTok followers. Walid Mohammed &mdash; a content creator whose influencer marketing agency, The Breadwinners Club, works with brands and startups targeting Gen Z audiences &mdash; was also upstairs and recently worked with Naqvi on Lore&#39;s early social presence. Housewarming, a visual blogging and moodboard social app, works out of a small office in Verci. Sydney Bradley While the space is collaborative, there is some friendly competition. &#34;On one hand, building in consumer is so hard, and sometimes you&#39;re isolated,&#34; said Michelle Yin , CTO of Housewarming. &#34;But then when you come here, you&#39;re like, &#39;Oh, everyone is in the same situation.&#39; It&#39;s both inspiring, but I also do feel like it breeds a little bit of intrinsic motivation and competition.&#34; The consumer tech industry has been crunched for funding as investors turn to AI and enterprise bets. Last year, only 6% of investments from top VC firms went to consumer tech startups, according to a recent report from Silicon Valley Bank. Several startups are working out of Verci&#39;s space. Sydney Bradley In the heart of Silicon Alley Verci exists within a broader consumer tech hub: New York City. &#34;It seems like everyone doing consumer social is in New York, and everyone knows each other,&#34; Yin said. She previously lived in the Bay Area while working as an engineer at Facebook. While not everyone is in New York, there certainly is a boom of new dating apps (like Sitch or Left Field), IRL social startups (such as Posh and Partiful), and other consumer social categories. Derek Chu, a partner at venture capital firm FirstMark, recently told me he&#39;s seeing a consumer tech &#34;renaissance&#34; in New York. The view from Verci&#39;s roof includes the Empire State Building. Sydney Bradley Jack Winston, cofounder of screen time control app BePresent, said the content creator and broader creative network in New York is helpful when building and marketing a consumer app right now. &#34;Founders in New York that are really successful in consumer social are successful because they have this ability to be tapped into the world,&#34; Vasudevan said.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/how-stay-at-home-mom-reentered-workforce-sales-2025-3",
    "description": "Amy Quindt, 42, got a sales job at AT&amp;T after striking up a conversation with a sales rep in her home. Amy Quindt Amy Quindt, 42, was a stay-at-home mom for years and struggled to reenter the workforce. She struck up a conversation with an in-home sales rep who was installing subsidized internet. He thought she was personable and welcoming, so he recommended her for a sales job at AT&amp;T. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Quindt, a senior associate in-home sales expert at AT&amp;T in Wisconsin. It has been edited for length and clarity. I was getting government-subsidized internet installed in my house &mdash; one I knew I was about two months away from losing when my life changed for the better. By the end of 2023, I was living with my 8-year-old son, Gabe, near Milwaukee, while my 10-year-old, Benji, lived with his dad in Chicago. Gabe, who is neurodivergent , in many ways behaves more like a 3- or 4-year-old than a kid his age. It became unsafe for him to be around Benji, so we separated households. To be close to Gabe&#39;s school in case of an emergency, I worked as a lunch lady at a nearby school for six hours a day. I knew I couldn&#39;t pay our bills for much longer on my salary. I asked for a raise and was able to get one when I took over another person&#39;s role. Just a few days after I started, that person asked for their job back, so my hours were cut. I was enrolled in the&nbsp; Affordable Connectivity Program for internet access, which provided discounts to low-income households. That&#39;s how I met Quentin. Quentin worked for AT&amp;T&#39;s in-home sales team and oversaw the internet installation in our house. I offered him something to drink and made sure he was comfortable. As we chatted, he asked me if I had ever considered working in sales . Within a month, I quit my cafeteria job and started working at AT&amp;T. Since I&#39;d mostly been a stay-at-home mom for 10 years, I had no idea how I&#39;d fare or if I&#39;d like sales. Over a year later, I&#39;ve doubled my salary and feel like I&#39;ve finally hit my stride. I worked lots of people-facing jobs Growing up, I felt like I took a different path from the high-achievers in my Wisconsin hometown. While others took on white-collar jobs, I worked in food service, eventually becoming a manager at Lou Malnati&#39;s in Chicago . Looking for a change, I briefly worked in door-to-door sales for a T-Mobile B2B campaign. I met my sons&#39; father at that job. I became a stay-at-home mom about a year later. For the next decade, I worked odd jobs in addition to watching my kids. A few months after giving birth to Benji, I briefly worked at a restaurant again. After Gabe was born, I looked for work opportunities as they came up, from babysitting to marketing essential oils on social media. I often got job leads by talking to people &mdash; a neighbor friend recommended me for the lunch lady position. Working became tougher during the pandemic. I was watching my kids full time in my mom&#39;s home because we couldn&#39;t afford to be on our own, and she needed caretaking help. My sociability made me stand out Quindt with her AT&amp;T colleague. Amy Quindt Even though Quentin was there to do his job, I still treated him like a guest. When he mentioned a sales role at AT&amp;T, we got frank with each other and talked. He said he appreciated my demeanor and hospitality . He fast-tracked me for the job. After I applied on the website, he connected me with his boss, who is now my manager. I interviewed during Christmas break and started in January 2024. The job had a lot of learning curves. I spent a month preparing for the role, including hands-on training. Every day, I get dispatched to different areas to visit customers. I&#39;ll do some research on the client and what they&#39;re getting installed before I meet them. I work a minimum of five days a week, starting the day around 7:30 a.m. and ending around 6 p.m., though my hours can vary based on where I am with meeting my goals &mdash; I&#39;ve worked until 10 p.m. on a Saturday before. The job can be challenging, but I also love what I do and feel like I&#39;m great at it. I finally feel like I&#39;m getting my life together I always felt like a late bloomer and like I got a slow start in life. I was a boomerang child living on and off with my mom until my late 30s. At 42, I finally feel like I&#39;m getting my life together. Within my first year at AT&amp;T, I learned so many skills that also helped me in my personal life, like better time management and project planning. So many of the changes have helped me better support my son. My hours work with his schedule &mdash; he qualifies for a neurodivergent-friendly school and gets free transport and government-assisted day care after school, so I can pick him up when I&#39;m done. I can also afford more resources for my son. I&#39;ve started keeping better track of his medical records from the Microsoft skills I learned at work. I&#39;ve also installed some safety features around the house, like window and cabinet locks. Having better healthcare coverage also means I can get him more testing and therapies that weren&#39;t covered by government insurance. I&#39;m more confident now, which carries over into the job, too. I&#39;m lucky someone saw me and gave me an opportunity. It&#39;s taught me that I&#39;m dedicated and nimble; I was able to adapt to big challenges and boost all aspects of my family&#39;s life. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Shield AI's cofounder says the US military needs 'more affordable, intelligent drones.' He thinks 'millions' could be built under the Trump administration.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/affordable-ai-military-drones-shield-ai-2025-3",
    "description": "Shield AI cofounder Brandon Tseng. Shield AI Shield AI builds autonomous drones and AI-powered software for the military. Cofounder Brandon Tseng says the US needs more affordable, intelligent drones to compete globally. Global interest in cost-effective, autonomous drones is growing with deals in Japan and Ukraine. Brandon Tseng was betting on AI in the military long before it became venture capital&#39;s latest craze. The former Navy SEAL, who served in Afghanistan, cofounded defense tech unicorn Shield AI in 2015 by asking himself one simple question: &#34;What role do AI and autonomy play in the military of 2035?&#34; he told Business Insider. A decade in, the 900-plus-person startup is riding a wave of demand for cutting-edge military tech. With the changing of the guard at the White House, there&#39;s even more optimism. While nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth wrote that &#34;technology is changing the battlefield&#34; and pledged to prioritize such modernization. Fresh off a $240 million fundraise at a $5 billion-plus valuation and a leadership shakeup &mdash; Tseng&#39;s brother and Shield AI cofounder Ryan stepped down as CEO last week, handing the reins to former Splunk chief Gary Steele &mdash; Tseng is clear on how AI and his company&#39;s technology can benefit the US and allied militaries. &#34;We need AI pilots,&#34; Tseng said. &#34;We need affordable drones. We can&#39;t be losing $40 million, $100 million aircrafts to really cheap weapon systems.&#34; Tseng envisions a &#34;hybrid force structure&#34; for modern militaries: a few expensive assets, like fighter jets and aircraft carriers, &#34;augmented by millions of more affordable, intelligent drones,&#34; he said. This approach, he thinks, will reduce the military&#39;s reliance on costly machinery and make it more nimble in areas with limited communication. Tseng&#39;s San Diego-based startup builds these kinds of autonomous drones, as well as an AI-powered military software called Hivemind, which enables drones to fly and make tactical decisions autonomously. Shield&#39;s flagship drone , the V-BAT, carries out intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments &mdash; even when communications systems are jammed and GPS isn&#39;t available &mdash; using Hivemind. Shield AI&#39;s V-BAT drone. Shield AI Last July, Shield AI clinched a nearly $200 million contract from the US Coast Guard to deploy its V-BAT drones, a push by the government to use drones to augment aircraft capabilities and to prevent the loss of costly warplanes to cheap enemy weapons. The accuracy of autonomous drones is a major selling point for companies like Shield: AI-powered drones are three to four times more likely to hit their target than drones piloted solely by humans, according to a Ukraine war researcher . Peter Tague, managing partner at the US Innovative Technology Fund, which participated in Shield&#39;s most recent fundraise, agrees that cost efficiency and tech innovation are key to the military&#39;s future. He also thinks that the Trump administration&#39;s focus on military innovation is good news for companies like Shield. &#34;Even in the prior administration, we were seeing an increasing push to apply new commercial technologies to the challenges facing our national security community,&#34; Tague wrote to BI in an email. &#34;Under President Trump we have only seen these priorities accelerate. &#34;The US military needs numerous flexible platforms to deter our adversaries,&#34; Tague continued. &#34;Within the drone space specifically, this will range from the exquisite &mdash; and expensive &mdash; platforms traditionally built by the large defense primes through attritable, man-portable devices like those being built in the thousands in Ukraine.&#34; The push for autonomous, cost-effective solutions isn&#39;t unique to the US. In January, Japan inked a deal to buy multiple V-BATs from Shield &mdash; marking the first-ever shipboard drone to be used by the Japanese navy. The deal reinforces governments&#39; rising interest in more cost-friendly, intelligent drones as the battlefield changes. Shield AI has also done crucial business in Ukraine. In January, the company opened an office in Kyiv and began training Ukrainian drone operators on using the V-BAT. In 2024, Ukraine purchased about 10,000 AI-enhanced drones , according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &#34;Ukraine has said they&#39;re building a million drones,&#34; Tseng said. &#34;China has said they&#39;re building a million drones. I think that you&#39;ll see the United States &mdash; under this administration &mdash; really make an effort to build millions of drones to augment our more exquisite capabilities.&#34; Investors pile into defense tech as founders face tough questions The swelling demand for autonomous weapon systems encompasses more than Shield&#39;s V-BAT, underscoring investors&#39; and the government&#39;s commitment to emerging defense technologies. Saronic, which makes autonomous surface vessels, quadrupled its valuation from $1 billion to $4 billion in just seven months with its Series C in February. Despite investors&#39; growing appetite for defense tech, founders building at the intersection of AI and warfare are wrestling with tough ethical questions &mdash; chief among them: Should AI make life-or-death decisions on the battlefield? The answer is clear for Tseng, who has faced those choices while serving in the military. &#34;It&#39;s a very human thing to make those decisions,&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#39;t ever believe that that should be ceded to AI or autonomy. … They should not independently be making the call whether to take human life. That belief is Shield AI&#39;s policy. It is US military policy, it&#39;s NATO policy.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "I'm a federal worker who commutes 15 hours a week after RTO. It's affected my marriage and social life.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-worker-rto-office-mandate-marriage-weekends-social-life-impact-2025-3",
    "description": "&nbsp; Eddie Brady/Getty Images A federal worker thinks Trump&#39;s RTO mandate has affected their marriage, energy, and weekends. Commuting every workday has been tiring; they used to commute just twice a week. Plus, as a military spouse, they think they will have to move in the future. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a federal worker. They&#39;ve asked to be anonymous for fear of job repercussions. Business Insider has verified their identity and employment. It&#39;s been edited for length and clarity. I work for the federal government, and we&#39;ve officially returned to working full-time in the office . That means my commute time has gone up to about 15 hours a week. I commute about three hours every day, an hour and a half in, an hour and a half back. The biggest change is the lack of energy that I have. I also have disabilities, so traveling is pretty tiring. My husband recently returned from his military training. We&#39;re figuring out what the new schedule looks like and how to support each other. We chose to live close to his base &mdash; about an hour and a half commute to my office by train &mdash; so he could be available for the soldiers under his command as things come up. At the time I was in a contract to only come into the office twice a week, so the commute seemed like an OK payoff. Now that I&#39;m going in every day, it&#39;s not quite as balanced. I&#39;ve definitely noticed a lack of energy around the house and the restructuring of our weekends, where we used to go out and do things, meet up with people, and engage. Usually we would meet up with friends at different places, like ice skating or go-karting or just a fun place for dinner. We also had regular game nights at different homes. It&#39;s definitely a lot more staying at home, getting things done around the house, running our errands, meal prepping, and things like that. Dealing with the often reckless and chaotic rollouts of different agendas has definitely left a huge mental toll. Supporting someone who is away for training in the military has been really difficult because I barely have enough energy for myself. It makes me sad. It&#39;s definitely not what I had anticipated happening this year for sure, and it&#39;s just been a drain. I think we are back full time in the office because of the confusion and the lack of clarity from executive orders and OPM guidance. There&#39;s been a lack of consistency in terms of who has to go back, when they&#39;re going back, and what&#39;s actually happening. There was an OPM memo that came out that said that all military spouses should be exempt from the return to office, but the implementation just hasn&#39;t been consistent. So even within my department, different components have implemented that guidance in different ways. With the implementation of the return to office, there&#39;s confusion regarding whether someone lives within 50 miles of the location , are they exempt from this order or not because are they technically remote. Because I&#39;m less than 50 miles, I&#39;m not exempt. We definitely will be relocating in the future because military families move all the time. Even if you live within 50 miles of where you work, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to take you less than 50 minutes to get to work. In DC, traveling 50 miles could take you two hours. It&#39;s not even a good measure of whether someone should be remote or not. For someone who&#39;s in the military, the work that they&#39;re doing, especially the work my husband is doing, is very stressful, and it&#39;s high energy all the time. It&#39;s very important that you&#39;re able to provide that support for them so that when they come home, they&#39;re not continuing to be stressed. There&#39;s got to be an unwind point. If I&#39;m also stressed the whole time that he is home, then we just live in the stress bubble, and neither of us has the energy to work through that. I came into the government for job security . You might not make as much money, but you&#39;ll have good benefits, and you have job security, and that is suddenly not there anymore. The uncertainty around the future is definitely a huge stress. We make the joke, we walk in and we say, &#34;Haha, we still have a job today.&#34; That&#39;s that dark humor of like, yeah, I still have a job, but I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen by the end of the day today or tomorrow. That&#39;s its own form of stress. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mhoff@businessinsider.com or Signal at madisonhoff.06.

    "title": "I tried chicken salad from Costco, Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and Whole Foods. There's only one I'd buy again.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/best-chicken-salad-to-buy-grocery-store-review-photos",
    "description": "After trying four different options, I found the best chicken salad to buy at the grocery store. Ted Berg I tried chicken salad from Costco, Trader Joe&#39;s , Wegmans, and Whole Foods. The Wegmans option was pretty expensive and didn&#39;t have a ton of flavor. However, I enjoyed the Whole Foods chicken salad, which was scooped fresh at the deli counter. I never enjoyed chicken salad until I started working at a deli in my early 20s. It quickly became a lunch staple for me, even though I had so many other sandwich options at my fingertips. Nowadays, I usually get my chicken salad fix at home when I have leftover grilled or rotisserie chicken . However, I wanted to see if I could find something worthwhile at the supermarket to enter my lunch rotation. So, I visited four major supermarket chains &mdash; Costco , Trader Joe&#39;s, Wegmans, and Whole Foods &mdash; and bought premade chicken salad at each one. I taste-tested all four with some crackers and ranked them from worst to first. Here&#39;s how they stacked up. I wouldn&#39;t buy the Wegmans grilled chicken salad again. I didn&#39;t think the Wegmans chicken salad had a ton of flavor. Ted Berg When I visited Wegmans , a 16-ounce tub of grilled chicken salad cost $15. Since that price seemed borderline outrageous, I hoped the chicken salad would be delicious. However, I was disappointed. There wasn&#39;t much flavor to it at all &mdash; the prevailing taste was that of mayonnaise &mdash; and it had an oddly grainy texture that closely resembled tuna salad . There was a good amount of chicken in the mix, which might help explain the price, but the meat lacked flavor and wasn&#39;t especially moist. The price point, more than the chicken salad itself, earned Wegmans the bottom spot on my ranking. Trader Joe&#39;s Wine Country chicken salad was too sweet for me. Trader Joe&#39;s Wine Country chicken salad had sweetened dried cranberries and pecans. Ted Berg Across multiple visits to three separate Trader Joe&#39;s in my area, the closest option I found to the others on this list was the Wine Country chicken salad. However, it differed slightly from the others as it incorporated sweetened dried cranberries and pecans. At first, I thought that might give it an unfair advantage in the ranking, since I normally enjoy a chicken salad with dried cranberries. The $5 price also seemed like a good deal for a 12-ounce container. However, this chicken salad was way too sweet for my taste and not quite hearty enough. It seemed like there was a lot more goopy liquid than chunks of chicken, and the cranberries tasted like candy. Overall, I thought this tasted more like a salad dressing than a deli salad. Costco&#39;s chicken salad was just OK. The Kirkland Signature chicken salad was greasy. Ted Berg I found the Kirkland Signature chicken salad in Costco&#39;s prepared foods section. It was priced at $6 a pound, making it the least-expensive option I tried on a per-pound basis. The container I picked up contained about 2 pounds of chicken salad. The salad had the biggest chunks of chicken of any I tried by far, but it practically shimmered with grease. I also thought it was bland in terms of flavor. However, since I was already familiar with the Kirkland Signature rotisserie chicken , the briny, brothy flavor of the meat was easy to pick out. There was celery in the mix, but it added more flavor than texture; ideally, I&#39;d prefer that reversed. The chicken salad was fine but not especially good, and it&#39;s hard to imagine a situation in which I&#39;d want two pounds of it. I&#39;d buy the Whole Foods classic chicken salad again. The chicken salad from Whole Foods was scooped fresh at the deli counter. Ted Berg Of the four chicken salads I tried, the version from Whole Foods was the only one that was scooped fresh at a deli counter. It was also the only one I&#39;d consider buying again. At $14 per pound, it was significantly more expensive than the chicken salads from Costco and Trader Joe&#39;s but slightly less expensive than the one from Wegmans. I appreciated that I could order only as much as I needed &mdash; a half-pound, in this case. It was easily the best-tasting of the four salads I tried. The chicken, chopped up into bite-sized pieces, was moist and tasted fresh. Although hardly bold in flavor, the salad was nuanced with the earthy sweetness of red onions, notes of rosemary, and a touch of mustardy bite. Unlike the others, it tasted better than anything I could easily make at home. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has emerged as the most frequent GOP critic of DOGE in the Senate. Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post and Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is one of the biggest DOGE critics among GOP senators. On Tuesday, she said Elon Musk may come after her as a result. She also says her GOP colleagues don&#39;t speak up because they&#39;re afraid of primaries. DOGE&#39;s top GOP critic in the Senate isn&#39;t intimidated by Elon Musk . That&#39;s the message that Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska conveyed in a press conference in Juneau on Tuesday, telling reporters that she could see the billionaire businessman spend money backing a challenger when she&#39;s up for reelection in 2028. &#34;It may be that Elon Musk has decided he&#39;s going to take the next billion dollars that he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski,&#34; the Alaska senator said, referring to herself in the third person. &#34;And you know what? That may happen. But I&#39;m not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to try to stand up for Alaskans.&#34; Sen. Lisa Murkowski said at a presser in AK yesterday that Elon Musk may &#34;take the next billion dollars that he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against&#34; her. Adds that GOP colleagues are silent because they&#39;re &#34;afraid they&#39;re going to be taken down&#34; or &#34;primaried.&#34; pic.twitter.com/pBwGvJFI0P &mdash; bryan metzger (@metzgov) March 19, 2025 Murkowski, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump , also said her GOP colleagues are largely silent on any criticisms they may have of his administration because they fear political blowback. &#34;They&#39;re looking at how many things are being thrown at me, and it&#39;s like, &#39;maybe I just better duck and cover,&#39;&#34; Murkowski said. &#34;That&#39;s why you&#39;ve got everybody just like, zip-lip, not saying a word, because they&#39;re afraid they&#39;re going to be taken down, they&#39;re going to be primaried.&#34; The Alaska senator has been a frequent critic of DOGE. In February, she said that the cost-cutting effort was creating a &#34;tremendous amount of unnecessary anxiety,&#34; and she has criticized the firing of federal workers in Alaska numerous times. In an address to the Alaska state legislature on Tuesday, she reiterated her concerns. &#34;These terminations are indiscriminate, and many, we&#39;re now learning, are unlawful. And they&#39;re being made regardless of performance and with little understanding of the function and the value of each position,&#34; Murkowski said. &#34;So at any human level, they&#39;re traumatizing people, and they&#39;re leaving holes in our communities.&#34; Murkowski has a bit more breathing room to criticize Trump and DOGE than other GOP senators. She&#39;s not up for reelection next year, and she beat back a Trump-backed primary challenger in 2022, in part with the help of the state&#39;s unique ranked-choice voting system. Still, the threat of Musk&#39;s wealth hangs over any GOP lawmaker who might consider criticizing Trump or DOGE. He has said that his super PAC, America PAC, will &#34;play a significant role in primaries&#34; going forward and acknowledged that he&#39;s open to supporting primary bids against Republicans who don&#39;t support Trump&#39;s agenda. &#34;How else?&#34; Musk wrote in November. &#34;There is no other way.&#34; He has even made that threat against Democratic lawmakers , leading one to laugh it off. A spokesperson for America PAC declined to comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-longevity-hacks-habits-drink-less-exercise-red-meat-vegetarian-2025-3",
    "description": "As he entered midlife, John Tregoning, a research scientist, decided to test out if any longevity treatments could make him feel healthier. John Tregoning/Getty Images A scientist tested out 15 buzzy longevity hacks to see if they made him feel healthier. John Tregoning tried things including calorie restriction, microbiome testing, and exercising more. He kept up with exercising more, drinking less, and eating more vegetarian meals instead of red meat. As he neared his 47th birthday, John Tregoning could no longer ignore the signs that he wasn&#39;t a spring chicken anymore. He had to hold his phone further and further away from his face to read it, and the pile of hair he left behind at the hairdresser was markedly more gray than blond. &#34;The period of denial was finally over,&#34; Tregoning, a professor of vaccine immunology at Imperial College London who has been a clinical researcher for 25 years, told Business Insider. Entering middle age, he began to wrestle with the idea of his own mortality, and whether there was anything he could do to delay it, or at least make his journey more pleasant. So he did what comes naturally to him when faced with a problem &mdash; a series of experiments. Tregoning researched the latest buzzy longevity hacks . Although it would be almost impossible to pinpoint whether they were extending his life, he wanted to see which were the most sustainable and made him feel healthier. He ruled out anything that didn&#39;t have at least a large clinical trial supporting its efficacy, and focused on interventions that would prevent diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease . These conditions are responsible for 74% of all deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. He landed on a list of around 15 lifestyle changes, medical tests, and treatments that are said to boost longevity . They were: gene sequencing, whole-body blood analysis, an ECG, more exercise, cold water swimming, eating beetroot, eating less salt, dry January and alcohol replacement, eating less red meat and more vegetables, brain training apps, sleeping more, a calorie restriction diet, eating more fiber, microbiome sequencing, and drinking more water. He documented his experience in his book &#34;Live Forever? A Curious Scientist&#39;s Guide to Wellness, Ageing and Death.&#34; He said his approach of experimenting on himself &#34;is definitely more illustrative than scientific&#34; because his findings are anecdotal. But he deemed anything that he continued to do after the experiment was over long-term a success. Tregoning shared the three longevity treatments he stuck with. Exercising more Tregoning tries to incorporate exercise into his commute. BartekSzewczyk/Getty Images Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As the heart is a muscle, working it through exercise makes it stronger and better able to pump blood around the body more efficiently, Tregoning wrote. So he decided to be more active in the name of heart health . Tregoning said that a year after setting himself the goal of exercising more, he still&#39;s at it. He likes to fit exercise into his commute, so he&#39;ll often get off the train a stop or two early and run the rest of the way. He also goes on runs with his daughter. Exercise also provides many health benefits that indirectly help the heart, he wrote, such as lowering body weight, reducing cortisol levels, and burning glucose . It also reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, stroke, and cancer. Drinking less alcohol Alcohol can damage the body in many ways, including causing certain types of cancer, contributing to heart failure and strokes by increasing blood pressure, and liver disease, Tregoning wrote. Tregoning attempted Dry January but didn&#39;t make it to the end. He has, however, continued to be more conscious of how much he drinks and records &#34;no drink days&#34; on an app, which he finds motivating. Eating more vegetarian meals (and less red meat) Tregoning eats at least two vegetarian meals a week. Magda Tymczyj/Getty Images Eating a diet high in red and processed meat has been linked to a higher risk of colon cancer while piling your plate up with high-fiber foods such as leafy greens and seeds appears to lower the risk. Eating meat can, in part, be counterbalanced with fiber, Tregoning wrote, by promoting smooth digestion and regular poops, which means the meat is in contact with the colon for less time. Instead of cutting red meat out altogether, which didn&#39;t feel realistic, Tregoning decided to add more vegetarian meals to his weekly repertoire. His favorites are three-bean chili , vegetable curry, and tomato pasta. He said that he still eats two vegetarian meals a week a year after ending the experiment.

    "title": "2 reasons why Nvidia's Jensen Huang isn't worried",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/jensen-huang-nvidia-ai-chip-demand-gtc-rubin-blackwell-hopper-2025-3",
    "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang showed off powerful new chips to convince investors that demand will remain high. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Jensen Huang is confident that queues for Nvidia chips aren&#39;t going anywhere. The Nvidia CEO is betting on its powerful new chips and an industry shift to inference. Investors are a bit jittery, however. Jensen Huang is betting companies will continue to spend billions of dollars with Nvidia. His confidence rests on two key reasons &mdash; though investors may need extra convincing. Kickstarting Nvidia&#39;s annual GTC conference in a San Jose arena on Tuesday &mdash; a developer bash now dubbed &#34;the Super Bowl of AI&#34; &mdash; the billionaire CEO pointed to powerful new chips and Nvidia&#39;s role in the industry&#39;s shift to inference, which is when AI performs tasks, as future demand drivers. Huang&#39;s big reveal was a new generation of Rubin chips, known as GPUs, that are expected to land next year and serve as a successor to the Blackwell and Hopper lines that have had the likes of Elon Musk , Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg queuing up. For context, an ultra version of Rubin &mdash; set for a release in the second of 2027 &mdash; would have 14 times the performance of an ultra version of Blackwell, which is expected to be released in the second half of this year. Huang promised further advances through 2028 by teasing a line of chips named after the physicist Richard Feynman. If such trends continue, these chips are expected to blow Rubin&#39;s performance out of the water once they arrive. That&#39;s certainly one way of keeping customers with deep pockets coming back. But after Nvidia suffered a $600 billion market capitalization loss in a single day in January following panic over DeepSeek, Huang was ready to offer another reason for why demand would stay &mdash; and it was a simple one. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images &#34;This is where almost the entire world got it wrong,&#34; Huang said during his GTC keynote, addressing the market&#39;s negative reactions to Nvidia after DeepSeek revealed a model that appeared to power its reasoning abilities in a phase called inference with fewer chips. &#34;The amount of computation we need at this point as a result agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily a 100 times more than we thought we needed this time last year,&#34; Huang added. Huang&#39;s comment comes at a time when top AI players have increasingly shifted their focus to producing AI models that reason, such as OpenAI&#39;s o3-mini and DeepSeek&#39;s R1. In Huang&#39;s vision of AI&#39;s future, these models require more computing power from chips, not less. He might have to argue his case a little harder, however. Investors reacted to Huang&#39;s remarks with some concern, as Nvidia&#39;s shares dropped by over 3.4% after the keynote. A few things will have been weighing on them. For one, concerns about DeepSeek&#39;s implications for chip demand linger. Then there&#39;s the slowing growth in Nvidia&#39;s revenue: 2024&#39;s fourth-quarter revenue of $39.3 billion was up 78% from a year prior but smaller than the 262% year-on-year growth experienced in the first quarter. Huang&#39;s bet will, of course, now be put to the test. The extent of demand for Nvidia&#39;s next generation of chips and their place in a world of AI models that reason will soon be apparent.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/jon-bernthal-punisher-return-daredevil-born-again-2025-3",
    "description": "Jon Bernthal as the Punisher and Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in &#34;Daredevil: Born Again.&#34; Giovanni Rufino/Marvel Studios Jon Bernthal said he originally declined to return as the Punisher in &#34;Daredevil: Born Again.&#34; The actor said the character&#39;s story originally didn&#39;t &#34;make sense&#34; to him. Marvel then creatively overhauled &#34;Daredevil,&#34; and Bernthal was happy to come back. Jon Bernthal said he initially turned down returning as the Punisher in &#34; Daredevil: Born Again &#34; because the character&#39;s story didn&#39;t &#34;make sense&#34; to him. &#34;Daredevil: Born Again&#34; is Marvel and Disney+ &#39;s continuation of Netflix&#39;s &#34;Daredevil&#34; show, which was canceled in 2018 after three seasons. Punisher appears in &#34;Daredevil: Born Again&#34; episode four, where Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) questions why corrupt police officers are using the Punisher&#39;s symbol as an excuse to murder criminals. The storyline references the way real-life officers were seen sporting the Punisher&#39;s skull logo on their uniforms. In the scene, Punisher has a haunting take on grief, loss, and retribution. But Bernthal almost didn&#39;t appear at all. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly about the episode, the actor recalled being unimpressed by the original plan for Punisher&#39;s return. &#34;Ultimately, I didn&#39;t see it. I didn&#39;t see the version of Frank, and what they wanted from Frank [didn&#39;t] really make sense to me and I thought would not appeal to the fans and wouldn&#39;t be congruent,&#34; Bernthal said. &#34;It was not something I was really interested in doing. So we had to walk away.&#34; After filming six episodes of &#34;Daredevil: Born Again,&#34; Marvel decided on a creative overhaul and brought &#34;The Punisher&#34; showrunner Dario Scardapane on board. Fresh ideas and a truer take on Punisher persuaded Bernthal to return. Jon Bernthal as the Punisher on the set of &#34;Daredevil: Born Again.&#34; Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images &#34;They really brought me into the conversation. We really got specific about where Frank is psychologically, where Frank&#39;s at physically,&#34; he said. Bernthal also touched on getting the chance to explore Punisher further in an upcoming special, which he&#39;s writing alongside Reinaldo Marcus Green. &#34;The story that we&#39;ve laid out is, I think, really special. It&#39;s the visceral, psychologically complex, unforgiving, no-holds-barred version of Frank where he&#39;s going to turn his back to the audience,&#34; Bernthal teased. &#34;And nothing is easy and all violence has a cost, and we&#39;re going to see that cost. I&#39;m grateful that they&#39;re letting me go to the places that I really want to go.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-predator-lawsuit-2025-3",
    "description": "Ryan Reynolds is seeking to dismiss Justin Baldoni&#39;s lawsuit against him and his wife Blake Lively. Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Ryan Reynolds is seeking to dismiss Justin Baldoni&#39;s $400 million defamation lawsuit. Reynolds argues that calling Baldoni a &#34;predator&#34; is a &#34;constitutionally protected opinion.&#34; Baldoni sued Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively after Lively filed a sexual harassment suit against Baldoni. Ryan Reynolds is trying to get Justin Baldoni&#39;s $400 million lawsuit against him and his wife Blake Lively thrown out, arguing in court papers that Baldoni&#39;s &#34;hurt feelings do not give rise to legal claims.&#34; In a motion to dismiss Baldoni&#39;s defamation lawsuit , Reynolds said that allegations that he called Baldoni a &#34;predator&#34; can&#39;t be defamatory since that would boil down to a &#34;constitutionally protected opinion.&#34; The motion, filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, says that the &#34;entirety&#34; of Baldoni and his business associates&#39; defamation claim &#34;appears to be based on two times that Mr. Reynolds allegedly called Mr. Baldoni a &#39;predator.&#39;&#34; Baldoni&#39;s lawsuit, Reynolds&#39; attorneys argue in the motion, &#34;alleges no plausible facts that suggest Mr. Reynolds did not believe this comment to be true.&#34; Instead, the allegations in Baldoni&#39;s lawsuit &#34;suggest that Mr. Reynolds genuinely, perhaps passionately, believes that Mr. Baldoni&#39;s behavior is reflective of a &#39;predator,&#39;&#34; the court papers say. The motion adds that the law &#34;establishes that calling someone a &#39;predator&#39; amounts to constitutionally protected opinion.&#34; Hollywood couple Reynolds and Lively have been embroiled in a contentious legal fight with Baldoni since December. Lively initially&nbsp; sued Baldoni , accusing him of sexual harassment on the set of&nbsp; &#34;It Ends With Us&#34; &nbsp;&mdash; the 2024 box office hit she starred in opposite Baldoni, who also directed the movie. Lively&#39;s suit, which names Baldoni&#39;s production company, Wayfarer Studios, his fellow producers, and his publicists as defendants, also accuses Baldoni and his associates of engaging in a retaliatory online smear campaign against her after she spoke out about the allegations. Baldoni, who has denied the accusations, then countersued Lively and Reynolds in a defamation complaint. Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively starred opposite each other in the movie &#34;It Ends With Us.&#34; Nicole Rivelli/Sony Pictures Entertainment Reynolds&#39; motion to dismiss Baldoni&#39;s lawsuit says that his wife sued Baldoni and his associates after they collectively launched a &#34;retaliatory &#39;social manipulation&#39; campaign to &#39;destroy&#39; and &#39;bury&#39; her.&#34; &#34;So what does Ryan Reynolds have to do with that, legally speaking, other than being a supportive spouse who has witnessed firsthand the emotional, reputational, and financial devastation Ms. Lively has suffered? Nothing,&#34; the motion says. Reynolds&#39; attorneys argue in the court papers that Reynolds is only named as a defendant because Wayfarer Studios billionaire cofounder Steve Sarowitz &#34;promised to spend up to $100 million to &#39;ruin&#39; Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds.&#34; Bryan Freedman, an attorney who represents both Baldoni and Sarowitz, told Business Insider in a statement that Reynolds&#39; involvement extends &#34;far beyond just being a &#39;supportive husband.&#39;&#34; &#34;Mr. Reynolds was a key player in the scheme, defaming Justin around Hollywood, strong-arming WME into dropping Justin as a client, and trying to destroy Justin&#39;s career however possible,&#34; Freedman said, adding that Reynolds&#39; &#34;fingerprints have been all over this smear campaign against Justin and the Wayfarer team since day one.&#34; Freedman said his clients won&#39;t stop until Reynolds is &#34;held accountable for his actions.&#34; Reynolds&#39; motion to dismiss says that Baldoni&#39;s lawsuit is &#34;long on hyperbole, prose, and &#39;claims,&#39; but devoid of any facts necessary to state ones recognized by law.&#34; &#34;It is, in essence, a burn book filled with grievances attempting to shame Mr. Reynolds for being the kind of man who is &#39;confident enough to listen&#39; to the woman in his life and to hold her &#39;anguish and actually&#39; stand with her,&#34; the motion says. Baldoni&#39;s lawsuit alleges that during the 2024 premiere of &#34;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,&#34; which Reynolds starred in, Reynolds approached an executive from the talent agency WME, which was representing Baldoni at the time, and &#34;expressed his deep disdain&#34; for Baldoni. The suit alleges that Reynolds suggested the agency was working with a &#34;sexual predator&#34; and at a later date, demanded that the agent &#34;drop&#34; Baldoni. The lawsuit also accuses Reynolds of calling Baldoni&#39;s then-WME agent and slamming Baldoni as a &#34;deranged predator.&#34; WME dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed her lawsuit. Reynolds&#39; lawyers Mike Gottlieb and Esra Hudson told BI in a statement that those allegations are &#34;not defamation unless they can show that Mr. Reynolds did not believe that statement to be true.&#34; &#34;The complaint doesn&#39;t allege that, and just the opposite, the allegations in the complaint suggest that Mr. Reynolds genuinely believes Mr. Baldoni is a predator,&#34; Reynolds&#39; lawyers said. &#34;Mr. Reynolds&#39; wife has accused Mr. Baldoni &mdash; privately and in multiple complaints &mdash; of sexual harassment and retaliation, and as pointed out by Mr. Reynolds&#39; motion, Mr. Baldoni has also openly spoken about his past of mistreating women and pushing the boundaries of consent,&#34; the lawyers continued. Reynolds&#39; attorneys said their client has a &#34;First Amendment right to express his opinion of Mr. Baldoni, which should be comforting to a group of people who have repeatedly called Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds &#39;bullies&#39; and other names over the past year.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX stake is his most valuable asset. Andrew Harnik/Getty Image Elon Musk&#39;s slice of SpaceX is worth $43 billion more than his Tesla stake, per Bloomberg. Tesla stock has been tumbling since December, reducing the CEO&#39;s net worth. SpaceX was most recently valued at $350 billion. The value gap between Elon Musk &#39;s stakes in Tesla and SpaceX has widened to $43 billion following the slide in the EV maker&#39;s stock. Musk has a stake of about 42% in SpaceX, according to Bloomberg. The rocket and satellite company was most recently valued at $350 billion , with his stake worth $136 billion taking into account a 5% private company discount. Musk&#39;s 13% stake in Tesla is worth $92.6 billion per Bloomberg&#39;s calculations &mdash;&nbsp;a difference of $43.4 billion. His holding in xAI is third, at $22.6 billion, with stakes in X Corp, The Boring Company and Neuralink also contributing to his wealth. Musk is still firmly atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index at $303 billion as of Tuesday&#39;s close. His net worth has cratered by $130 billion, or 30%, this year largely due to the fall in Tesla stock . It&#39;s down more than 50% from mid-December, wiping some $800 billion from its market cap to just above $700 billion at Tuesday&#39;s close. Tesla closed 5% lower on Tuesday. Musk became the first person to be worth more than $400 billion in December. Tesla stock surged after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. Musk had aggressively campaigned for Trump, spending more than $200 million. However, sliding Tesla sales have unnerved investors, along with criticism of Musk&#39;s political interventions with DOGE. The average price of a used Tesla is now $10,000 less than that of a non-Tesla electric vehicle, Business Insider previously reported based on data from the dealership website CarGurus.

    "description": "A woman works at an early model desktop computer made by Servus, circa the 1970s. Hulton Archive/Getty Images During the early 20th century, women&#39;s employment was affected by war and advancements in tech. In the 1960s and 1970s, women were able to expand their horizons and career opportunities.&nbsp; Vintage photos from the past 100 years show how their roles have changed. Working women have come a long way in the last 100 years.&nbsp; In the 1920s , women entered the workforce in astonishing numbers as a result of the industrial revolution.&nbsp; Then, as men were sent off to war, more women got involved in the wartime effort in factories and other professions previously dominated by men. Women&#39;s equality movements throughout the 1960s and 1970s gave working women even more opportunities, and in recent years, the gap between men and women in the workforce is closing, according to data released by the US Bureau of Labor. These vintage photos show how the role of women in the workforce has evolved in the last 100 years. In the wake of the Industrial Revolution, more women than ever began to leave the household and go out to work. Women postal workers at a sorting office, circa 1920. FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Jobs commonly held by women included postal clerks, who sorted letters and packages. While it wasn&#39;t uncommon for women to work in post offices, very few women actually delivered mail. The US Postal Service reported that in 1920, only 5% of the nation&#39;s 943 village carriers were women.&nbsp; As local postal delivery was gradually phased out in favor of larger city delivery, most of the remaining women village carriers either resigned or were transferred to clerk positions. Many women also began working in factories. The operating room of Ladies Rayon Undergarment Factory, 1920. George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images The US Department of Labor reported that in 1920, women made up about 20% of the labor force, an increase from previous generations. Many of them were involved in the production and manufacturing of clothing, food products, and tobacco products. Women of color, on the other hand, were largely employed in agriculture and domestic service work for much of the early 20th century. During World War I, women held occupations in domestic and personal service, clerical occupations, and factory work. Woman working in an office, USA, circa 1921. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images Many women took typing courses to secure higher-paying jobs as secretaries or typists in clerical offices rather than working in factories. The Encyclopedia of Chicago reported that working conditions, wages, and hours in clerical work were seen as the best at the time. Clerical work attracted young, literate, mostly white women who would work as typists until they were married, only to be replaced by other young unmarried women when they left their jobs to raise their families. After the Women&#39;s Bureau was established in the US Department of Labor, women had access to more industries.

Hulton-Deutsch/Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis/Getty Images As the popularity of silent films began to rise, women found work behind the scenes on movie sets. The Women Film Pioneers Project wrote that a 1923 edition of &#34;Business Woman&#34; published a list of 29 different jobs that women held in the film industry, apart from actresses. Job positions included that of a typist, secretary to the stars and executive secretary, costume designer, seamstress, telephone operator, hairdresser, script girl, film retoucher, title writer, publicity writer, musician, film editor, director, and producer, among others. Women also held jobs as blacksmiths and worked on vehicles. A female blacksmith at work in her workshop, circa 1920. Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images However, most occupations were seen solely as a precursor to marriage. Among married white women of both native and immigrant backgrounds, only around 10% were in the workforce, History &nbsp;reported. It was more common for married women of color to hold jobs outside the home, however. Unemployed women during the Great Depression could join &#34;SheSheShe&#34; camps. During the Great Depression, several women attended a work camp at Bear Mountain for unemployed, homeless, and single women.

Many families during the Great Depression were able to achieve middle-class status by adding another working member to the household &mdash; in many cases, a woman.

Women also earned incomes by sewing clothes in Works Progress Administration (WPA) sewing rooms. The rooms manufactured products such as men&#39;s trousers, boys&#39; coveralls, baby clothes, women&#39;s dresses, and diapers.&nbsp; By 1945, one in every four married women worked in jobs outside the home.

Forbes reported that between 1940 and 1945, women&#39;s participation in the US workforce increased from 27% to nearly 37%.&nbsp; By 1943, women made up 65% of the US aircraft industry&#39;s workforce.

Universal History Archive/Getty Images Before the war, women were largely in traditionally &#34;female&#34; fields such as nursing and teaching. After Pearl Harbor, many women entered the armed forces at astonishing rates. In 1943, more than 310,000 women worked in the US aircraft industry, making up 65% of the industry&#39;s total workforce, History reported. Before the war began, women made up just 1% of the industry. In 1935, women made 25% less than men for government jobs.

Mondadori/Getty Images A 1935 law titled the National Recovery Act actually required women who held jobs within the government to receive 25% less pay than men in the same jobs. In 1942, during wartime, the War Labor Board ruled that women would be paid the same as male workers who were now away at war. However, the war ended before they could receive equal pay. With no laws to protect female workers from pay inequality, female workers in the 1940s earned around 60% of what their male counterparts made, MarketWatch reported. Women were largely seen as &#34;supplemental&#34; workers in the 1950s, meaning their income was secondary to their husbands&#39;. A waitress serving men breakfast in the 1950s. William Gottlieb/CORBIS/Corbis/Getty Images Even though there were technically more women in the workforce in 1952 than during the war, women were often paid less and given jobs with less upward mobility than their male counterparts. After the war, women returned to stereotypically &#34;feminine&#34; jobs. In some cases, jobs were advertised for women only. A businessman and a secretary in the 1950s. George Marks/Retrofile/Getty Images Many women were forced to give up the jobs they had worked in during wartime, giving them to male soldiers returning home. The most popular jobs for women during the 1950s were secretaries, bank tellers or clerical workers, sales clerks, private household workers, and teachers, The Week reported. Female secretaries in the 1950s gained a reputation for being young and attractive. In fact, a 1959 quiz from a secretarial training program in Waco, Texas, reposted by The Atlantic , asked women if they have what it takes to be a secretary, including &#34;smiling readily and naturally&#34; and being &#34;usually cheerful&#34; among its requirements.&nbsp; The 1950s marked the beginning of the &#34;jet age,&#34; and many young women found work as flight attendants, then called &#34;stewardesses.&#34; Regular Delta C&amp;S Stewardess Mary Lee Shultz, of Memphis, adjusts a colleague&#39;s cap as they both prepare for flight in the operations room, 1956. Getty Images Flight attendants during the 1950s became symbols of the golden age of flying &mdash; when traveling by air was seen as the height of sophistication and glamour. However, with this &#34;glamorous&#34; career also came a host of sexist protocols. Condé Nast Traveler reported that women were not allowed to work as flight attendants after they reached the ages of 32 to 35, while male flight attendants could work well into their 60s. In 1957, Trans World Airlines dropped its no-marriage rule for female flight attendants. However, many airlines continued to only hire non-married female flight attendants. While many women joined the workforce, they were nevertheless expected to fulfill their duties at home, in what would be coined &#34;the second shift.&#34; An American housewife in 1960 demonstrated the cleaning power of Vel detergent in a TV ad. Hulton Archive/Getty Images After women returned home from their secretarial or office jobs, they had another job to do: caring for the children, doing the housekeeping, and, of course, putting a hot dinner in front of their husbands.&nbsp; This became known as the &#34;second shift.&#34; If women didn&#39;t hold office or other jobs during the day, they were relegated to being &#34;housewives.&#34; In the 1950s and 1960s, women found creative ways to make their own incomes from their homes.

Women were also making history in their careers. American broadcast journalist Barbara Walters eats a sandwich as she works at her desk in New York in 1966.

Authenticated News/Archive Photos/Getty Images Smithsonian Magazine reported that &#34;computer girls&#34; became a term for &#34;savvy young women&#34; pursuing careers in computer programming. Computer programming was seen as &#34;easy&#34; work similar to typing or filing, so many women ended up building the field that would come to be known as software development.&nbsp; Women soon made up a majority of the trained workforce in the computing industry.

Stan Meagher/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Title VII was added to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, protecting workers from employment discrimination&nbsp;based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1963, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed in order to protect men and women who perform &#34;substantially equal work in the same establishment&#34; from sex-based wage discrimination. These measures were especially beneficial to women of color. Up until the 1970s, women of color could be openly discriminated against in the hiring process and were often assigned to providing &#34;domestic service work&#34; to white families, The Economic Policy Institute reported.&nbsp; During the 1970s, computing work gained more prestige as the industry realized how valuable computers would become.

Hulton Archive/Getty Images It meant women were no longer welcome in many computer programming offices.&nbsp; &#34;They weren&#39;t going to put women workers &ndash; seen as low-level drones &ndash; in charge of computers,&#34; Hicks told The Guardian. Female computer workers, or &#34;computer girls,&#34; were gradually phased out and replaced with men, who received higher salaries and more prestigious job titles. By the 1970s, many women were still fighting for better workplace conditions, equal pay, and more job opportunities. A businesswoman in the 1970s. H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images The Atlantic reported that from 1972 to 1985, the number of women working &#34;professional&#34; jobs increased from 44% to 49%. The number of women working &#34;management&#34; jobs nearly doubled, rising from 20% to 36%.&nbsp; However, in 1970, women still did not earn equal wages to men holding the same positions. In the 1970s, education became more important than ever for securing a well-paying job. Nurses and doctors at Pelham Bay General Hospital examine a patient&#39;s X-ray in 1975. Eric Bard/Corbis/Getty Images After measures were passed that prevented universities and institutions from discriminating against students on the basis of sex, more women were admitted into medical school than in past generations, according to a study published by the British Medical Bulletin . Other strides were made for women in the late 1970s. In 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed as an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which meant that women could start building families without fearing how it would affect their careers. Women in the workforce in the 1980s continued to make strides, but there was still a way to go. Marilyn Neckes, a former TV producer who changed careers to a stockbroker, in 1984. Barbara Alper/Getty Images The Atlantic reported that, in 1985, half of all college graduates were women. However, only 41% of women between the ages of 25 and 44 held full-time year-round jobs. Even in the mid-1980s, women themselves saw their own careers as inferior to their husbands&#39;. The Atlantic also cited a 1985 Roper survey that showed only 10% of women said that a husband should turn down a &#34;very good job&#34; in another city &#34;so the wife can continue her job.&#34; However, women of the 1980s made history in their fields.

Women were encouraged to &#34;do it all&#34; &mdash; meaning, hold a successful job as well as maintain a happy and healthy marriage and raise children. In the 1990s, women overwhelmingly began to be employed in offices and earned higher salaries. CDC employee working at a computer in 1995.

Women were also postponing marriage and children until later in life. Two businesswomen view the latest stock prices on the Nasdaq Wall in 1997. James Leynse/Corbis/Getty Images For most earlier decades, women would be married between the ages of 20 and 22, Time reported. The average age for women to get married rose to 24 in 1990, and by 1997, it was 25. In 1995, nearly half of all women surveyed for a report by the National Center for Education Statistics said they earned half or more of their total family income.&nbsp; In recent years, women held more jobs than men in the US workforce.

Wally Santana/AP Images Fortune reported that at the start of 2020, 109,000 more women were working than men, and women in the US made up 50.4% of the labor force. Sectors that traditionally hire women, like healthcare and education, were growing, and other industries previously dominated by men were also hiring more women than ever before. Forbes reported that 13.8% of mining and logging jobs were held by women, and more women were employed in manufacturing and transportation than in years past. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the women&#39;s labor force participation rate to hit a 33-year low in January 2021. A mural urging people to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic. FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images CNBC reported that more than 2.3 million women in the US left the labor force between February 2020 and January 2021, compared to about 1.8 million men who registered as unemployed. This placed the women&#39;s labor force participation rate at 57%, the lowest rate since 1988, according to the National Women&#39;s Law Center. However, the actual number of women who were unemployed may have been much higher due to those who may have left the labor force but were not actively looking for work. In January 2021, 275,000 women left the labor force, accounting for 80% of all unemployed workers over the age of 20 that month. The situation was even worse for women of color . According to the NWLC, 8.5% of Black women aged 20 and over were unemployed in January 2021, compared to 8.4% in December 2020 and 4.9% in February 2020. Adversely, the unemployment rate for white men aged 20 and over was 5.5% in January 2021, compared to 5.8% in December 2020 and 2.7% in February 2020.&nbsp; By 2025, nearly half of all US employees were women.

AsiaVision/Getty Images A 2024 report by the Independent Women&#39;s Forum said that in 16% of all US households, women are the primary or sole &#34;breadwinners.&#34; The report also revealed that 29% of households reported that both male and female spouses earned the same amount of money. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics also reported that in 2025, the unemployment rate for women was slightly lower than the rate for men. Women also have a 57.5% participation rate in the labor force, compared to 67.6% for men. Many women are also starting their own businesses and choosing entrepreneurship over traditional careers.

    "title": "My husband and I had a sleep divorce for 5 months. I never want to do it again.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/parents-sleep-divorce-now-prioritizing-being-back-in-bed-together-2025-3",
    "description": "My husband and I (not pictured) spent months sleeping apart. I&#39;m glad he was able to get some good rest, but I prefer having him by my side. Westend61/Getty Images With our first child, I was adamant that my husband had to suffer through sleepless nights with me. For our second, my husband moved to spare room so at least one of us could get some decent sleep. While I&#39;m fine with the choices we made, we didn&#39;t like feeling like roommates. For nearly half a year, I chose to share my bed with a male other than my husband &mdash; it was my youngest son. I kicked my husband out and into the spare room so I could co-sleep safely and comfortably with our second child, officially making us sleep divorced &mdash; something I never thought I&#39;d do. It saved our sleep and sanity for a while, but when it ran its course, we had to be proactive about how we got back together, where we were meant to be. With my first child, I was adamant that my husband had to suffer with me Before having kids, I never understood the appeal or need for co-sleeping . Then, of course, I had kids. It was a long first year with my oldest, now 6, who didn&#39;t sleep through the night until he was just over a year old. I would fantasize about saying goodnight to him and not hearing another peep out of him until 7 a.m., but as it went, we would usually see each other at least 5 times a night, if not more. So I&#39;d give in and let him sleep next to me. During that time, I was adamant that my husband remain in our bed, to try to help share the load of soothing our nocturnally disgruntled son. It was mainly unsuccessful, but I wanted him there to provide solidarity and moral support. The second time around, I had a change of heart Those sleepless nights felt like a distant memory by the time our second son came along, when our oldest was nearly 4. I&#39;d heard about the fabled easier second baby, and in some ways, this was true. Our youngest slept for longer stretches at night than his night owl brother in the newborn phase. Then it all changed at the textbook 4-month sleep regression stage, dominated by my son&#39;s unquenchable appetite. He seemed to spend all night on my breast, dozing contentedly with a nipple in his mouth. It made me feel like I didn&#39;t really go to bed, that I was just clocking off from one shift to another, and simply changing out of day clothes and into pajamas. But this time, with a demanding older kid to also take care of, I made the call to kick my husband out of our bed, and into the spare room. It didn&#39;t make sense for both of us to be exhausted when it was only me the baby wanted. At bedtime, we&#39;d go our separate ways, me settling in for the night shift, and my husband looking forward to his restful, uninterrupted night &mdash; which I didn&#39;t begrudge him for, as he did (and still does) a lot of the heavy lifting during the day. While admittedly it was a little lonely, it made things slightly easier for me. Despite still having to soothe the baby multiple times a night, being just the two of us made it easier and safer to co-sleep. My quality of sleep was better as I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable sandwiched between the two people. And I wasn&#39;t disturbed every time my husband went to the bathroom or got up in the morning, nor was I anxious that his movements would wake the baby. The arrangement worked for us &mdash; until it didn&#39;t We even kept this arrangement during a 6-week working vacation in Greece that summer. Our youngest was then 8 months and shared the main bedroom of our rental apartment with me, while my husband and our 4-year-old each took a single bed in the second room. While our setup helped me get as much rest as possible to enjoy that trip, that&#39;s when I really missed my husband the most. Despite being in a romantic vacation destination, there was very little romance going on. When we did get a chance to talk, we established that we were both ready to get back together. We recognized that we gave everything to our kids during the day, and that sleeping in the same bed, on our own, felt like the last space that was just for us. We were tired of feeling like co-parents and roommates, rather than two people in a loving relationship. So on our return, we put &#34;operation eviction&#34; into place. It took some time and planning, but we eventually were able to adjust our sleeping arrangement. Around 14 months, our youngest started sleeping through the night and out of my bed, and my husband and I were able to find a place for our relationship again. We prioritize our personal space, but know we can adjust when our kids need us to The only time since our sleep divorce that my husband and I have slept apart was when our oldest had to spend a week in hospital, in April 2024, to be treated for a kidney infection. That experience showed how resilient and adaptable we are, and committed to our kids. So we don&#39;t feel bad about being protective of our personal space the rest of the time, because when it counts, we are ready to step up. There was a period in our lives where sleep was a priority at the cost of our relationship, but after that chapter, it&#39;s time to prioritize ourselves again. Our sleep divorce days are behind us, and unless there&#39;s another medical emergency with one of our kids, I can&#39;t see them being in the cards again.

    "description": "O&#39;Brien has outlined CR&#39;s 2025 publishing push, including at least two books by the company&#39;s cofounders. Robyn Von Swank/Critical Role The nerdworld business Critical Role is making a big push into publishing this year. Its publishing drive, led by Liam O&#39;Brien, includes two books written by the cofounders. Also on the 2025 slate are art books, comics, and novels written by Penguin Random House authors. Liam O&#39;Brien &mdash; known to fans as the heartbreak prince &mdash; has worked on all parts of Critical Role&#39;s business, from writing for its animated series to live-streaming for its gothic horror gaming venture. Now, he&#39;s overseeing the company&#39;s bigger push into print. O&#39;Brien is one of the eight leaders of the nerdworld business Critical Role . Over the past decade, he and his friends have built a multi-division geek empire that spans animation , game publishing , podcasting , streaming , and live shows . CR&#39;s book publishing dates back to 2017, when the crew released titles like their first &#34;Vox Machina&#34; art book. But now, as the company celebrates its 10th anniversary, they&#39;re making a proper go at publishing, with a full slate of books to be released in 2025. In a call from his office &mdash; which houses a massive shelf of geeky books and nerdy paraphernalia &mdash; the self-described &#34;literary dork&#34; outlined what CR&#39;s push into the publishing business will look like. 2 cofounder-written kids&#39; titles CR plans to publish at least two children&#39;s books written by its cofounders in 2025. The first, &#34;Der Katzenprinz,&#34; is a book of fairy tales O&#39;Brien wrote and is scheduled for release on April 8. O&#39;Brien said the book is a collection of three dark and mystical fairytales, all grounded in the fantasy world of Exandria. &#34;I was just diving into fairytales, which I grew up on and love. I have books on the shelf behind me that are from when I was a kid, that are full of dark, weird stories,&#34; O&#39;Brien said. The second CR cofounder-written book is &#34;Smiley Day: A Good Advice Book From Your Favorite Robot Therapist,&#34; by CR cofounder Sam Riegel. It will be released on September 30. &#34;When you&#39;re a parent, you read a lot of children&#39;s books &mdash; and some of &#39;em are great, and some of &#39;em were not great,&#34; Riegel, a father of two, told BI. &#34;And we thought, &#39;Maybe we should try to make a good one.&#39;&#34; More D&amp;D-based novels CR has partnered with authors under the Penguin Random House stable to roll out novels based on their &#34;D&amp;D&#34; campaigns. An early title released in 2021 under this collaboration was &#34;Vox Machina &mdash; Kith &amp; Kin,&#34; a novel-length deep dive into the backstories of the half-elven twins O&#39;Brien and CR cofounder Laura Bailey played on stream. The Penguin Random House slate for 2025 includes &#34;Tusk Love,&#34; a novel by Thea Guanzon, inspired by characters in CR&#39;s second long-running campaign. And there&#39;s a short story collection with a foreword from O&#39;Brien, &#34;Vox Machina &mdash; Stories Untold.&#34; &#34;The team at Critical Role is incredible at telling stories, so it just made sense to expand those stories into books,&#34; said Elizabeth Schaefer, the publishing director at Random House Worlds. &#34;The setting and characters are so rich that we&#39;ve been able to publish a wide variety of books&mdash;from novels to a cookbook, to a behind-the-scenes making of, to even an advice book,&#34; Schaefer said. O&#39;Brien joked that he ended up taking charge of CR&#39;s literary offerings because &#34;the others are too busy&#34; &mdash; but it&#39;s all worked out since he loves books. And as part of the team&#39;s publishing drive, it&#39;s O&#39;Brien&#39;s job to curate CR&#39;s art books. He also consults on the company&#39;s graphic novel collaborations with Dark Horse Comics. &#34;I grew up an avid reader, and my slippery slide into tabletop role-playing games and fantasy was through reading novels,&#34; O&#39;Brien said. &#34;So really, my whole life has been about being a big nerd and then deciding, &#39;Well, I need to be an adult now,&#39;&#34; he said. &#34;And then realizing that that was incorrect and then just fusing it all together.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "As an American living abroad for six months, I noticed some surprising things about European homes. Peter Gudella/Shutterstock; Evannovostro/Shutterstock I spent six months living in Europe and noticed some differences from houses in the US. In Europe, it&#39;s less common to see electric dryers and air-conditioning units. However, heated towel racks are a staple in many European bathrooms. When my husband and I traveled around Europe for six months, we looked at several accommodation options. Although we booked hotels or inns for some of our shorter stints, we chose to stay in three long-term Airbnbs for a total of four months. We made a conscious choice to only rent from local Airbnb hosts and ended up meeting all of them during our stays. This worked out well, as they were able to give us local recommendations and show us how to use some of the more finicky features in the homes &mdash; some of which were quite surprising to me as an American. Here are five things that surprised me most about houses in Europe. Electric dryers feel like a rarity. In Europe, it&#39;s common to use drying racks to air dry clothes. Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images In Europe, dryers aren&#39;t as common as they are in the US. Instead, many people air-dry their laundry. Thankfully, the apartments we stayed in all came with large drying racks. Although strange at first, we quickly got used to having a steady rotation of clothes drying in our living room . Washing machines seem to have long cycles. European washing machines seem smaller than the ones we have at home. Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images Another thing I noticed was that the washing machines seemed much smaller than the ones we have at home. So, I could only wash what I&#39;d consider a small load at a time. However, this didn&#39;t usually equate to quicker washes. The default setting for our washing machine in Prague was four hours, but our host reassured us that we could use the &#34;speedier&#34; option of 3 hours and 20 minutes and still get a good clean. This was pretty shocking to me, as I&#39;m used to my clothes being washed in about an hour. Tilt-and-turn windows are a wonderful design concept. The windows in Europe are different from what I&#39;m used to seeing in the US. Peter Gudella/Shutterstock The windows in most European houses I stayed in were drastically different from what I&#39;m used to finding in the US. Rather than sliding up to open, the common &#34;tilt-and-turn&#34; windows have a handle on them. When you turn the handle to the side, you can swing the window fully open toward you. However, if you keep turning the handle until it&#39;s facing up , the window opens a crack from the top, allowing fresh air to come in, even in bad weather. Many homes in Europe don&#39;t have air conditioning. Air conditioning isn&#39;t common in many places in Europe. xphotoz/Getty Images During my travels, I heard an Irish woman telling her friend that she couldn&#39;t imagine air conditioning being everywhere. She said it would be weird to be cold in the summer months. I understand where she was coming from. It&#39;s not my favorite to go from a blistering 90-degree-Fahrenheit day to a freezing grocery store. However, it&#39;s also not fun to be lying in bed on a 90-degree night with only a small fan to cool you down. For our two-month stay in Prague over the summer, we had to go out of our way to find an Airbnb with air conditioning. Although we found places with air conditioning available, we did end up paying a bit more for the luxury. It wasn&#39;t the most powerful of air conditioners, but the small white box on the wall did a decent job of keeping us cool. Heated towel racks seem to be a staple in European bathrooms &mdash; and they get way hotter than I expected. Heated towel racks seemed to be popular in Europe. Evannovostro/Shutterstock When I first saw a ladder-like device in my bathroom in England, I figured it was just a towel rack. Then, the owner showed us how to use the knob at the bottom to control the temperature of the heated towel rail. At first, I was intrigued by the idea of having a nice warm towel when I got out of the shower. It also seemed like a great way to quickly dry my towel afterwards. However, once I tried it out for myself, I didn&#39;t find it very convenient to use. There only seemed to be two temperatures: barely warm or melt-your-skin-off hot. Then, to use it, I had to wedge the towel in and awkwardly shimmy it down, all while avoiding the sizzling hot rails. After a few months, I gave up the fight and just left the rack turned off.

    "description": "Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty This post originally appeared in the Business Insider Today newsletter. You can sign up for Business Insider&#39;s daily newsletter here . Good morning. New documents filed by the Justice Department shed light on how far the White House has gone in trying to cut probationary staff from the federal government. It&#39;s the largest insight yet into the mass firings . Oh, and if you&#39;re missing your usual anchor Dan DeFrancesco, he&#39;s got a funny story for you from parental leave . In today&#39;s big story, tech companies are sending a message to employees: The days of perks and pampering are over. What&#39;s on deck Markets: Tesla&#39;s stock slide accelerated , but employees aren&#39;t too concerned . Tech: What Google&#39;s $32 billion Wiz acquisition means for other startups &mdash; and Trump . Business: Don&#39;t call it a recession, but the vibes aren&#39;t good . First, the tables have turned. The big story &#39;We can give severance, but we can&#39;t slow down&#39; Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty; Getty; Rebecca Zisser/BI Do more with less. That&#39;s the new mantra in Silicon Valley. Gone are the days of the in-office massage, the free laundry services, and the fancy food. Layoffs and budget cuts have become pervasive in response to a trifecta of issues: economics, post-pandemic realities, and political pressure. But CEOs aren&#39;t just ending the office pampering &mdash; they want everyone to know it. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, the message is clear: Tech is going hardcore . Here are just several examples of how tech companies have changed their tune: Zuckerberg said Meta needs more &#34; masculine energy &#34; and that the company&#39;s culture has been &#34;neutered.&#34; Google has been on an efficiency drive . Sergey Brin, a Google cofounder who remains a board member and controlling shareholder, advised in a memo that employees work 60-hour weeks . Microsoft shed its &#34;country club&#34; moniker as it moved to cull low performers . Elon Musk&#39;s acquisition of Twitter in 2022 came with sweeping cuts and a new commitment to an &#34;extremely hardcore&#34; vision. The free lunches were removed. At one point, workers were begging for toilet paper and clean bathrooms. Big Tech leaders haven&#39;t been shy about adopting hard-driving strategies. But what do their employees think? BI reporters interviewed staff at tech giants including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta &mdash; as well as various startups &mdash; about the changes. &#34;There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days,&#34; a current Google manager told BI. A recruiting firm cofounder said he&#39;s heard multiple leaders tell their employees the same thing: &#34;If you&#39;re not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can&#39;t slow down.&#34; Tech employees had it sweet. Now, they have to sweat . 3 things in markets Business Insider 1. Tesla&#39;s stock slide just sped up. Shares are on pace to fall for a 9th straight week, and the slide accelerated on Tuesday thanks to a hailstorm of issues involving its CEO, competition, and expectations on Wall Street. However, Tesla&#39;s employees &mdash; many of whom receive large stock grants as part of their compensation packages &mdash; aren&#39;t worried . 2. Stagflation is the market&#39;s big bogeyman. Investors dumped a record amount of US stock last week. Growing stagflation fears were key , a Bank of America survey found, with 71% of fund managers saying they expected it to hit the global economy in the next 12 months. 3. Predicting where stocks could go next. It&#39;s a bad idea to use news headlines when trying to guess where the markets will go. Technical analyst Helene Meisler told BI the five charts she&#39;s using instead to gauge market sentiment, and what she sees in its future. 3 things in tech The CEO of Wi. Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch 1. A big acquisition with bigger implications. Google&#39;s parent company Alphabet has acquired the cybersecurity firm Wiz for a whopping $32 billion. The deal rewards early Wiz investors , but other startups could stand to benefit if it catalyzes an M&amp;A cycle. It&#39;ll also test the regulatory environment under Trump. 2. Elon Musk has gone MIA as CEO. He&#39;s not the only one. Musk&#39;s reign at DOGE has Tesla investors wanting their CEO back &mdash; but he&#39;s not the first chief executive to go AWOL. Company morale and productivity are paying the price. 3. Everything Jensen Huang revealed at the Nvidia conference. The CEO shared the company&#39;s road map for the next few years, including updates on the next generation of chips. He also introduced Blue, a &#34;Star Wars&#34;-like robot, to show off a partnership with Google and Disney. 3 things in business OsakaWayne Studios/Getty, jayk7/Getty, Mark Kolpakov/Getty, Charles Gullung/Getty, wasan prunglampoo/Getty, Tyler Le/BI 1. One year after the real-estate revolution. A landmark settlement upended traditional industry practice by changing the way real estate agents are paid. Now, some Americans are saving big on homebuying . 2. The vibecession is back. The US isn&#39;t in a recession, but Americans feel like they&#39;re in one. That&#39;s thanks to recent market volatility, Trump&#39;s shifting tariff policies, and more. Even if the economy isn&#39;t doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession still has serious consequences . 3. Inside JPMorgan&#39;s RTO plans for its largest office.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/easy-ways-get-more-protein-in-morning-dietitian-breakfast-ideas",
    "description": "Greek yogurt bowls are one of my favorite easy ways to get more protein into my diet in the morning. EMS-FORSTER-PRODUCTIONS/Getty Images As a dietitian, I love protein-packed breakfasts and always try to eat protein in the morning. I like having Greek yogurt bowls, overnight oats, or smoothies on when I don&#39;t want to cook. Sometimes, I reheat parts of my dinner leftovers for breakfast to hit my protein goals. As a busy dietitian , having protein at breakfast is non-negotiable for me. In fact, I view it the same way as brushing my teeth in the morning. Getting enough protein is important for one&#39;s overall health and well-being. It can help with stabilizing blood-sugar levels, building muscle, regulating appetite, and more. Although having protein with every meal is ideal, getting enough of it at breakfast is especially important. By doing so, you can feel more satisfied with your meal and have more energy throughout the day . Here are the easiest ways I incorporate protein into my breakfasts. Greek yogurt is my favorite no-cook food to get enough protein in the morning. Greek yogurt with granola and fruit is an easy breakfast. Rachel Hosie I try to always have Greek yogurt in my fridge to use as a base for a protein-packed breakfast. I usually choose options from the Oikos Pro brand, which has flavored yogurts with at least 20 grams of protein and no added sugar. Sometimes, I even just use a plain, nonfat Greek yogurt. Either way, I top my yogurt with whatever fruit I have on hand, sunflower-seed butter, and a bit of granola. This combination keeps me full for hours. Protein-packed overnight oats are easy to prepare in advance. Overnight oats are easy to customize with different toppings. AnnaPustynnikova/Getty Images Overnight oats are fantastic for fueling me through the day. I like to prepare a few batches at the start of the week so that I can grab them quickly on fast-paced mornings. I make mine with oats, ground flax seeds, milk, Greek yogurt, vanilla, and protein powder. After mixing those ingredients together and allowing them to sit overnight, I top my oats with fruit the next day and enjoy. Loaded cereal is a fun way to practice balance in the morning. I try to buy high-protein cereals that I can add toppings to. Tatiana Maksimova/Getty Images Cereal is rarely filling on its own. Many varieties primarily consist of carbohydrates, which can leave us feeling unsatisfied soon after eating. I don&#39;t eat cereal often, but when a craving hits, I try to honor it while packing in protein to prevent a blood-sugar crash later in the day. First, I start with a higher protein cereal . Before adding my milk, I use a frother to mix a scoop of protein powder into it. Then, I top my bowl with fruit and ground flax seeds. I get that nostalgic cereal taste while also providing my body with extra protein and fuel. Smoothies can be surprisingly filling depending on what you put into them. I usually add a scoop of protein powder to my smoothies or use Greek yogurt as my base. Xsandra/Getty Images I wouldn&#39;t have a smoothie without protein for breakfast, but the good news is that it&#39;s super easy to make sure it&#39;s in there. I like using protein powder or Greek yogurt. If you find it hard to eat in the morning yet want to get some nutrition in, try adding more protein to your usual smoothie to make it feel more satisfying. Sometimes, I just repurpose dinner leftovers for breakfast. Last night&#39;s dinner could be today&#39;s protein-packed breakfast. Luc TEBOUL/Getty Images There&#39;s no rule that breakfast needs to be eggs, toast, or other traditional foods many of us associate with the first meal of the day. In my house, it&#39;s normal to heat up leftovers from the night before and eat them the next morning. Plus, it&#39;s convenient and a nice way to avoid food waste. My typical dinners usually feature chicken, lean beef, or salmon, which makes it super easy for me to hit my protein target. Leftovers can also be easy to customize and turn into a new dish by adding eggs, seasonings, veggies, or hot sauces. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/ellen-pompeo-joined-greys-anatomy-broke-tv-films-2025-3",
    "description": "Ellen Pompeo in &#34;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#34; season 21. Anne Marie Fox/Disney Ellen Pompeo said she originally auditioned for &#34;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#34; because she was broke. She said on the &#34;Call Her Daddy&#34; podcast that she really wanted to act in films. &#34;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#34; ended up being her breakout role, making her $20 million a year by 2018. Ellen Pompeo said she accepted the lead role in &#34; Grey&#39;s Anatomy &#34; for the money after going broke trying to start a movie career. &#34;Grey&#39;s Anatomy,&#34; which debuted in 2005 and is now on its 21st season, was the first series created by Shonda Rhimes and was the foundation of her TV production empire that includes &#34;Scandal,&#34; &#34;Bridgerton&#34; and &#34;How To Get Away With Murder.&#34; In a new episode of the &#34; Call Her Daddy &#34; podcast, Pompeo said she didn&#39;t initially want to join a TV series because she wanted to be a movie star. &#34;I had all these people call me and tell me how amazing I am and I should stay on this track. Why are you trying to derail me and put me over here?&#34; Pompeo recalled. At the time, Pompeo had supporting roles in films including &#34;Daredevil&#34; and &#34;Catch Me If You Can,&#34; but was yet to get a big break. &#34;I was trying to be in good movies with great directors, but they were only really small parts, so I kept doing those. I kept getting cut out of those, and then I had no money left,&#34; she said. Pompeo said her agent eventually persuaded her to join &#34;Grey&#39;s Anatomy.&#34; The agent said she could make money from the pilot episode and the show wouldn&#39;t get picked up by a network, meaning she could return to her movie career. &#34;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#34; did get picked up and became Pompeo&#39;s breakout role and her main acting gig. In 2023, the actor scaled back to a recurring role to do other projects. &#34;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#34; creator Shonda Rhimes and Ellen Pompeo. Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images Pompeo hasn&#39;t said what she was paid initially for the show, but by the 2010s Forbes had begun listing the actor as one of the highest-paid actors on TV. In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter said Pompeo had negotiated a new deal to make more than $20 million a year, including a salary of $575,000 per episode. Pompeo said on the &#34;Call Her Daddy&#34; podcast she spoke to Rhimes to get her blessing before asking for the raise, even though Rhimes had no control over the decision. &#34;I don&#39;t want to come off crazy, and I want to let her know what moves I&#39;m making because I do respect her,&#34; Pompeo said. &#34;She was like, &#39;Yeah, no one&#39;s going to give it to you &mdash;&nbsp;you have to ask for it.&#39;&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "The Duke freshman has all the tools to flourish as a professional. But the potential to earn money in college means staying amateur has upsides Late in the first half of Duke’s recent game against Georgia Tech, Blue Devils star Cooper Flagg suffered an ankle sprain so gruesome that he had to be helped off the court in a wheelchair. Five years ago, losing college basketball’s biggest draw to a heart-stopping injury on the eve of the NCAA Tournament would have had Duke fans death-spiraling along with the game’s corporate stakeholders. So why do those fans seem so relieved? For one thing, it looks as if the freshman will be fit for Duke’s first-round game on Friday. For another, he could be at Duke for a while yet: a scary injury is no longer a spur for talented college players to turn professional and make money while they still can. That all changed in July 2021, when the NCAA allowed college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness (NIL), and make money while they’re still students. By letting go of one of its foundational tenets (the notion that “amateurs” should not be paid), the NCAA now has its member schools scrambling to build sponsorship war chests to lure top talent. The athletes, for so long the biggest losers in the NCAA’s billion-dollar amateur system, are finally making gains, meaning they are less inclined to turn professional as soon as possible.

The league’s board, comprising owners in the two professional men’s circuits (the second-division USL Championship and the third-division USL League One) voted to enact promotion and relegation within the USL ecosystem. If it comes to fruition, it will be the first time promotion and relegation will exist in the modern history of US soccer.

She was returning from Major League Baseball’s offseason meetings in New Orleans. It was 2003 and Hoppel had been learning about MLB’s new software system. Meanwhile, her baby had just been born. “I had already done the nursery and everything, because I’m a planner,” Hoppel says recently. She is organized by nature and by profession – her job involves overseeing things like the immigration process for international players. At the time she was 42, had been divorced for three years, and wanted to be a mom. A friend of hers had gone through the adoption process. “And it just hit me like, you know that that’s what I want to do.” Continue reading...",

After an inauspicious start, the association co-founded by Novak Djokovic has spent time building its professional structures, finances and player support while trying to gain influence in the sport. The PTPA ostensibly functions as a players’ union, but it is not legally recognised as such, since players are classed as independent contractors rather than employees. As the PTPA’s numerous attempts to gain a seat at the sport’s decision making table have been rebuffed, often vigorously, by the leading governing bodies – the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the four grand slam tournaments – it became increasingly likely that their acrimonious relations would lead to litigation. The PTPA’s decision to initiate a lawsuit against the ATP, WTA and ITF on Tuesday, while naming the grand slams as co-conspirators, marks a dramatic intensification of its campaign for players’ rights. It also comes as no great surprise. Continue reading...",

The Manchester City attacker has often been inspired for his club and insipid for his country. He was the best offensive player in the Premier League last season, scoring 27 goals in all competitions, but he flattered to deceive during England’s baffling run to the final of Euro 2024. A solitary dazzling performance in the semi-final victory over the Netherlands merely heightened the frustration. Playing as an inside-forward in Gareth Southgate’s rejigged 3-4-2-1 system, Foden was at his bewitching best in that game. He drifted into pockets and ran at defenders, teasing them with his close control and sharp one-twos. He hit the woodwork with a wondrous shot from long range. He burrowed into the area, all quick feet and low centre of gravity, and had an effort hacked off the line. He was involved during one of England’s best moves during the second half, slipping a clever pass into Kyle Walker, who was marginally offside when he crossed for Bukayo Saka to sidefoot past Bart Verbruggen from close range.

    "description": "Forward became youngest player to appear in NWSL’s regular season against Seattle – and Gotham say she is ready Over the weekend the National Women’s Soccer League started its 13th regular season, marking the 19th year of top-flight women’s soccer in the US (together with the WPS and WUSA that came before it). As is typical for an ever-expanding, aspirational league that still sees itself as a “ scrappy startup ”, the new year set off with myriad changes, milestones, and hopes for another historic year. There are certainly signs they’ll get that. Amid the early indications of the same dominant teams returning, marquee stars scoring again and a competition staying fierce across the table, the opening weekend featured one notable benchmark that is worth extra consideration: a 14-year-old debutant for Gotham.

However, West Ham’s proposal of a deal worth £100,000 a week to the England midfielder, who is of interest to Barcelona, is not high enough.

As the world tried to digest the full horror of the Hillsborough disaster, the future of the national game seemed at a crossroads. Surely this was the tragic tipping point for the sport, a time for English football to get its house in order. For too many years the safety of spectators had been taken for granted. Crumbling stadiums, perimeter fences and poor facilities provided a hostile environment in which to attend matches. The shocking policing of Liverpool fans at Hillsborough, shamefully covered up for decades, combined with this disregard for safety, led to a tragedy beyond comprehension. Continue reading...",
