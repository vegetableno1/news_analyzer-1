    "description": "Adobe’s Firefly apps, now available on iPhone and Android. The all-in-one platform for Adobe’s Firefly-branded generative AI models is now available on iPhone and Android devices. The new Firefly mobile app allows users to generate images and videos using text descriptions and experiment with popular AI photo editing tools, enabling creatives to generate assets for their projects on the go. Adobe is also introducing new third-party AI models and video generation support to Adobe’s FigJam-like Firefly Boards platform. The Firefly app for iOS and Android includes access to Adobe’s text-to-image , text-to-video , and image-to-video tools, alongside the Generative Fill and Generative Expand features that can also be found in Adobe’s Photoshop software. Users can additionally choose from a selection of third-party AI models when using Firefly features, including Google’s Imagen 3 and 4 image models, Veo 2 and 3 video models , and OpenAI’s image generator . Anything generated using the Firefly mobile app will automatically sync to the user&#8217;s Creative Cloud account, making it easier to continue working on the web or in Adobe’s creative desktop apps. As with the desktop Firefly web app , some of the Adobe AI tools on mobile will require users to spend Firefly generative credits, which are obtained as monthly allocations, either via paid Creative Cloud plans or a dedicated Firefly credit subscription. Adobe has also rolled out new video capabilities to the public beta of its collaborative Firefly Boards whiteboard platform that launched in April. Users can now remix uploaded clips and generate new footage via Adobe’s Firefly video model or third-party tools like Google’s Veo 3. New partner models, including Luma AI’s Ray 2, Ideogram 3.0, Runway’s Gen-4 image, and Pika’s text-to-video generator, are being introduced to Firefly Boards, and will be available in other Firefly app features “soon,” according to Adobe.",

Maybe it's unfair, but we've come to expect Nintendo to consistently amaze us with either how its consoles work or the games you can play with them. In this case, it still feels like a Switch. Only better. And not universally better, either . On this episode of The Vergecast , now that a number of folks on our team have spent some real time with the Switch 2, it's time to talk about how we feel about this new console. First, The Verge 's Andrew Webster joins the show to talk through his review, from the controllers to the design to the game-changing games here and yet to come. Then, The Verge 's Ash Parrish tells us about her experiences traveling with the Switch 2, how her experience has compared to her first demos of the device, and the games she's been playing so far.

    "title": "The Nissan Leaf is finally getting the makeover it deserves",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/687542/nissan-leaf-2026-refresh-specs-range-charging",
    "description": "Nissan revealed new details about the upcoming 2026 Leaf , which will return as a crossover SUV with up to 303 miles of estimated range, dual charge ports, and Google’s software built-in. The reborn Leaf will reach dealerships in the US starting this fall at a yet-to-be-announced price. The first-gen Leaf was somewhat charming — in an ugly kind of way. The second gen was not much better , with bland styling and an outdated CHAdeMO charging port that practically screamed “obsolete.” The 2026 Leaf is a significant improvement over previous generations in almost every way. Gone is the frumpy hatchback, replaced by a sleek, stylish crossover with improved aerodynamics (0.26 drag coefficient, down from 0.29) and an estimated range between 259 and 303 miles ( up dramatically over the current maximum range of 212 miles). The new Leaf will also set itself apart with dual charge ports, one a standard CCS-compatible port and an additional NACS port that allows access to Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network. This is sure to make refueling the 2026 Leaf a better experience than it was with the old CHAdeMO-equipped models. “We have completely reconstructed the values of the next-generation Leaf,” said Tase Nobutaka, program design director at Nissan, in the press release. “We made it simple and clean, yet with a more energetic feeling. We ensured the all-new Leaf has a dynamic shape, testing it time and time again to reach our ambitious aerodynamic targets.” “We have completely reconstructed the values of the next-generation Leaf.” It’s a huge step up from the current Leaf, which was last refreshed in 2023. Despite its status as a pioneering EV with its zero-emission powertrain and affordable starting price, the Leaf was teetering on the brink of discontinuation as Nissan struggled with low sales and declining relevancy. Now it has been resurrected and revived with a set of specs more compatible with the current era than the one from which it emerged. Car buyers, especially Americans, have soured on hatchbacks, preferring anything resembling an SUV. Even the frumpy Toyota Prius has been reimagined as a sleeker, sportier sedan, so it only makes sense that the Leaf would get its own glow-up. The 2026 Leaf sports a new 75kWh, liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack paired with a 214-horsepower electric motor. It can fast charge at up to 150kWh, and its dual ports will provide a level of flexibility that doesn’t require an adapter, although fast charging is only allowed through one. On the driver side, above the fender is a J1772 charge port that’s compatible with most home and public Level 2 chargers. On the passenger side, a NACS port will allow fast charging at any Tesla Supercharger . The new Leaf will also be Nissan’s first EV with Plug and Charge , which allows drivers to just plug in and start charging without the need to submit payment information or sign up for a third-party app. Nissan estimates that fast charging from 10 to 80 percent will take 35 minutes. The Leaf S will be the base trim, while the S Plus and SV Plus trims offer upgrades like a bigger battery and 18-inch alloy wheels.&nbsp;Nissan is also adding a fourth trim level, Platinum Plus, which features 19-inch wheels and a 10-speaker Bose system with built-in front headrest speakers.&nbsp;The base model S trim, which won’t be available until spring 2026, will come with a smaller 52kWh battery and 174-hp motor, and will likely get an estimated 255 miles of range. An enhanced battery thermal management system and a heat pump will also make the Leaf the ideal EV to charge in winter. The Leaf’s battery pack is sealed by a resin cover, helping keep out cold air, snow, and slush during winter driving. The Leaf will also capture “wasted heat” from the drive motor and the onboard charger, and repurpose that heat to help warm the battery to its ideal temperature range.&nbsp;An onboard heat pump, which comes standard on all trims, will efficiently warm the cabin during colder months. And a battery heater can help bring the pack to the optimal temperature for fast charging when the mercury drops. Dual charging ports will provide a level of flexibility that doesn’t require an adapter. Dual charging ports will provide a level of flexibility that doesn’t require an adapter Nissan says its engineers tested the new Leaf over 1,500 days in both the deserts of the Southwest and Fairbanks, Alaska, to gauge how well charging holds up in extreme heat and extreme cold. The design of the new Leaf is a lot cleaner and more streamlined, with retractable door handles (a first for Nissan), concealed rear handles in the C-pillar, an illuminated logo in the front grille, stacked rectangular lighting, and an optional full-width light bar. The 2026 Leaf is built on the modular CMF-EV platform that also undergirds the&nbsp; Ariya EV . This platform features Nissan’s &#8220;3-in-1&#8221; powertrain setup that combines the motor, inverter, and reducer into a single unit. With Google built-in, the Nissan Leaf seamlessly integrates apps like Google Assistant, Google Maps, and Google Play into a vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. Google Maps, for example, will show the vehicle’s range and battery capacity, and on certain routes it’ll suggest charging stops when the destination is beyond the battery’s capacity. S and S Plus trims will have dual 12.3-inch screens that connect wirelessly to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. On SV Plus and Platinum Plus trims, those screens expand to 14.3 inches. All trims feature ProPILOT Assist steering assist, lane centering, and adaptive cruise control. The new Leaf also comes with a Nissan-first safety technology called Secondary Collision Mitigation Braking, which automatically applies the brakes after the airbag is deployed to help reduce the severity of a crash or prevent a secondary crash into another vehicle. Nissan is promising more details on the new Leaf, including price, before the end of the year. The company also recently announced that new ICE and plug-in hybrid versions of its Rogue SUV, and refreshed models of its midsized Pathfinder SUV and Sentra sedan, would be coming soon.&nbsp; Ideally, the new Leaf will provide a much-needed boost to Nissan. The automaker has been going through a particularly rough patch, with&nbsp; declining sales &nbsp;and&nbsp; the collapse of a merger deal &nbsp;with Honda. It definitely needs some fresh products to help boost its overall image. And while the Leaf certainly isn’t fresh, its new look is sure to turn a few heads.",

    "title": "Microsoft should change its Copilot advertising, says watchdog",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/688056/microsoft-copilot-advertising-watchdog-response",
    "description": "Microsoft’s Copilot advertising has been criticized by an industry watchdog for its productivity claims and confusing use of Copilot branding. The Better Business Bureau&#8217;s National Advertising Division (NAD) has reviewed Microsoft’s Copilot advertising , and recommended that the software giant discontinues or modifies productivity claims about Microsoft 365 Copilot and more clearly disclose the limitations of its Business Chat feature. Microsoft has been claiming that Copilot has productivity and return on investment (ROI) benefits for businesses that adopt the AI assistant, including that “67%, 70%, and 75% of users say they are more productive” after a certain amount of Copilot usage. “NAD found that although the study demonstrates a perception of productivity, it does not provide a good fit for the objective claim at issue,” says the watchdog in its review. “As a result, NAD recommended the claim be discontinued or modified to disclose the basis for the claim.” Alongside the recommended productivity advertising changes, NAD also suggests that users of Copilot could be confused by Microsoft’s wide use of the Copilot branding across multiple products — including Business Chat. “NAD concluded, based on the context of the claims and universal use of the product description as ‘Copilot,‘ that consumers would not necessarily understand the differences.” NAD has recommended that Microsoft now “modify its advertising to clearly and conspicuously disclose any material limitations related to how Business Chat assists users.” Microsoft has had years of confusing branding for Copilot. Microsoft relaunched its Copilot for business with free AI chat and pay-as-you-go agents earlier this year, in an attempt to simplify some of its branding woes. Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat as it’s known now, started off as Bing Chat Enterprise before Microsoft then rebranded it , confusingly, to just Copilot. Somewhere in the middle of all this rebranding, Business Chat — which was originally a chatbot in Teams — is now Business Chat for Microsoft 365 Copilot. As I wrote in Notepad almost a year ago , Microsoft has been rebranding Copilot in the most Microsoft way possible. It’s all part of trying to make businesses use Copilot more , and then pay extra for the Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription. Microsoft says it disagrees with NAD’s conclusions, but that it “will follow NAD’s recommendations for clarifying its claims.” Hopefully that means that Copilot branding is going to be clearer in the future.",

    "title": "The Atlantic is making a big push into games",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/687721/the-atlantic-games-hub-bracket-city",
    "description": "Daily puzzle games are seemingly everywhere right now, and starting today, you’ll be able to add a new stop to your puzzle rotation: The Atlantic . The publication is launching a new hub for its growing game offerings , including already available games like Bracket City and Caleb&#8217;s Inferno Crossword Puzzle, as well as some new puzzles. You’ll be able to access the hub on both the web and in The Atlantic’s app. Caleb Madison, The Atlantic’s director of games, gave The Verge a demo of most of the games available in the hub ahead of today’s launch: Bracket City , which The Atlantic licensed earlier this year , requires you to solve clues nested in brackets that eventually resolve into a fun fact about that day in history. Stacks , a new game, is kind of like Tetris meets Wordle , Madison says. You have a bank of words that you have to place in the correct order, on top of letters already on the board, to form other words. In Fluxis , another new game, you try to figure out words that build off the previous word and incorporate some kind of characteristic. Madison showed me an example of needing to build an adjective off the word “checkerboard” — he went with “arduous.” Caleb&#8217;s Inferno Crossword Puzzle , which is already included in the monthly Atlantic magazine and available online, is last game Madison showed me. Caleb’s crossword is a narrow rectangle instead of a square, but as you move farther down the puzzle, the clues get more difficult to solve. Madison doesn’t necessarily see The Atlantic’s games as replacing your visits to other daily puzzles. “I think people have a pretty ravenous diet for new games, so I don’t think coming to The Atlantic precludes any of these other amazing games that are at The New York Times or Apple News or LinkedIn,” Madison says. “What I feel like The Atlantic has to offer that’s different from those publications is a little bit more of a bespoken, artisanal aesthetic.” Madison also tries to bring an “aesthetic narrative component” to games to help them feel “immersive and special.” Bracket City , for example, has some city-themed elements sprinkled throughout, like the “fan mail” email being mayor@bracket.city . Like with The New York Times , some aspects of The Atlantic ’s games will only be available if you’re a paid subscriber. Bracket City and all of its archives are free. The full archives for Stacks , Fluxis , and The Atlantic ’s daily mini crossword will be behind a paywall, however; nonsubscribers will only have access to the three most recent puzzles for those games. All of the Caleb’s Inferno crossword puzzles are exclusive to subscribers. Madison says he has “a lot of plans” for more games, including long-form games of some kind. “I’m trying to make no assumptions as to what that would look like and just forge forward creatively to see what a more layered day-to-day experience would be like.” He didn’t want to give anything specific away, but he says, “I am excited to innovate in the game space and bring unique and authentic, long-form game experiences to The Atlantic users and to people online.”",

    "title": "OpenAI awarded $200 million US defense contract",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/688041/openai-us-defense-department-200-million-contract",
    "description": "The contract is estimated to complete in July 2026. OpenAI is officially on the Pentagon’s payroll. The Department of Defence announced a $200 million contract with OpenAI to provide the US government with new artificial intelligence tools, including those used for proactive cyber defense. In a post outlining its latest contracts, the DoD said that OpenAI “will develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains.” The work will primarily be completed in the Washington, DC region with an estimated completion date of July 2026. OpenAI said in a new blog post that the DoD contract is its first partnership under a new initiative to provide its AI technology to workers across federal, state, and local governments. The company is offering custom models for national security on “a limited basis,” according to the announcement, with OpenAI saying that all use cases must comply with its policies and guidelines. OpenAI’s current usage policy bans its services from being used to “develop or use weapons” and “injure others or destroy property.” “This contract, with a $200 million ceiling, will bring OpenAI’s industry-leading expertise to help the Defense Department identify and prototype how frontier AI can transform its administrative operations, from improving how service members and their families get health care, to streamlining how they look at program and acquisition data, to supporting proactive cyber defense,” OpenAI said. This isn’t the first time OpenAI has bedded down with the military, having entered a partnership with Anduril Industries in December 2024 to integrate its AI software into the defense tech company’s counterdrone systems. The new one-year DoD contract is antithetical to earlier versions of OpenAI’s terms of service that banned its technology from being used for “military and warfare” — a prohibition removed by the company last year. OpenAI’s DoD contract is the latest of several efforts to bolster military efforts with AI technology, with the US having renamed the AI Safety Institute earlier this month to focus on combating national security risks instead of overall safety. Rival AI developer Anthropic announced an AI model with looser guardrails for US defense and intelligence agencies on June 5th, Google removed commitments in February to not use AI in ways “that cause or are likely to cause overall harm,” and Meta started allowing the US government to use its Llama AI model for “national security applications” last year.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/685299/amazon-prime-day-2025-dates-when",
    "description": "Amazon has announced the dates when its annual Prime Day deal extravaganza will kick off, and it’s happening for much longer than usual. It starts Tuesday, July 8th, at 3AM Eastern and lasts through Friday, July 11th, at the same time. And, instead of being a two-day event that’s exclusive to Prime subscribers , it’s happening for four days in 2025. We will, of course, be reporting for deal duty for the duration, supplying only on the discounts that matter to Verge readers. Four days is a very long time, and we currently don’t know if Amazon plans to blast out the majority of good deals on day one, or divvy them out evenly across the event’s duration. At least, it will attempt to organize the deals with a new “Today’s Big Deals” feature for subscribers, which recaps the biggest deals across various categories. We expect to first see deals arrive on Amazon’s own suite of devices, including Echo smart speakers, smart displays, and other smart home gear. This includes its Kindle lineup, as well as its Fire TV streamers and TVs that run its entertainment-focused OS. Amazon teased some of its early deals beginning soon, which include its lowest price yet on the Blink Mini 2 two-pack as well as the Ring Battery Doorbell bundled with the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus. It also plans to offer the eero 6 Plus mesh Wi-Fi router system, the Fire HD 8 Plus tablet, and more products at up to half off. Once Prime Day begins, deals will expand to include other popular manufacturers that Verge readers care about. Every company under the sun typically takes part in Prime Day on both big-ticket gadgets and affordable tech. We’ll be covering the best deals on TVs, laptops, headphones, tablets, video games, PC accessories and components, and so much more. To reiterate, Prime Day deals are only for Prime subscribers, so you’ll need a subscription to participate (even if it’s a trial). For those who are between the ages of 18 and 24, you can get a six-month subscription for free , with it renewing after that period at $7.49 per month (half the normal cost of Prime). If you’re unsure as to whether you’ll have time to peruse all of the deals with us, you can opt to get a tidy email digest of only the top deals, both on a regular basis and during Prime Day, by subscribing to our Verge Deals newsletter below.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/687609/tinder-double-date-launch-us",
    "description": "Tinder is no longer just a platform for solo dates. The company has announced a new “Double Date” feature rolling out in the US that will let you invite a friend to find — and match with – another pair. The feature lives within a new “Double Date” icon in the top-right corner of the app, where you can invite up to three friends to create pairs with. You can both scroll through a feed of paired profiles, which appear side by side with photos and descriptions. A match is created when one person from both pairs swipes right. Tinder will then open up a group chat with all four users. The update should help Tinder gain an edge over rivals as the dating app industry continues to experience a slump . It will also allow Tinder to compete directly with platforms built for double dates, like Doubble and Fourplay. Cleo Long, Tinder’s head of product marketing, told The Verge that the platform has been testing the feature in Europe for a “couple of months,” adding that it’s meant to help relieve dating pressure, especially among younger users. “This is a social-first experience that&#8217;s really meant to help relieve some of the pressure that we know a lot of Gen Z experiences with dating by making it more social, more fun, and bringing your friends in to help reinforce that comfort piece,” Long said. Double Dates builds on some of the other social features Tinder has rolled out in recent years, including a feature that lets you share the details of your dates with other people, as well as a way for friends or family members to find matches for you. Tinder plans on rolling out Double Dates globally in July.",

    "description": "Last year, Justin Sun was facing a federal investigation into his crypto empire , to the point that he avoided entering the US. Now, his company is going to be publicly listed on the American stock markets – and reportedly with the assistance of Eric Trump. Tron, Sun’s digital assets platform, announced on Monday that it plans to go public in the U.S. via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a Nasdaq-listed company that previously designed merchandise for theme parks before pivoting to crypto. At the same time, Trump’s sons announced the launch of Trump Mobile , an MVNO that will also sell a $499 gold Android phone.&nbsp; On the company’s site, SRM states that it has worked with Walt Disney World, SeaWorld, and Sesame Place. SRM says it has raised $100 million from a private investor to buy the Tron tokens (TRX), with plans to issue shares and warrants valuing the deal at up to $210 million. The deal was brokered by Dominari Securities, a New York-based boutique investment bank operating out of Trump Tower, whose board includes both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, the president’s sons. Shortly after Trump’s election, Sun became an advisor and investor in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto company, and promptly bought $75 million of their memecoin, $TRUMP, when the token launched in January.&nbsp; By the end of February, the SEC had officially paused its investigation into Sun’s businesses . Sun continued to invest in Trumpworld entities, both in crypto and elsewhere: in May, he won a private dinner with the president by buying $16 million worth of $TRUMP in a contest. According to an unnamed source cited by the Financial Times , Eric Trump, who oversees the Trump Organization’s private sector holdings, is expected to take a position at the company, which will be renamed Tron, Inc.",

    "title": "Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals",
    "description": "Apple’s AirPods Pro with ANC are a tempting upgrade — especially when you can pick them up for $30 off. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the newer AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C . The same goes for the original AirPods Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector and a few new color options. &nbsp; The best AirPods 4 deals The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals The best AirPods Max deals Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. The best AirPods 4 deals At its September event , Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments. The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.&nbsp; Although they launched at the end of last year, we’ve consistently been seeing discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are matching their all-time low of around $99 ($30 off) at Amazon , Walmart , and Target . The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, meanwhile, are on sale at Amazon , Walmart , and Target for around $148.99 ($30 off), which remains their second-best price to date. Read our full AirPods 4 review . The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features a USB-C charging case and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with Apple’s new Vision Pro headset and doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids . As far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available at Amazon , Walmart , and Best Buy for around $169 ($80 off), which remains their second-best price to date and about $15 short of their all-time low of $153.99. Read our AirPods Pro with USB-C impressions . The best AirPods Max deals The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people —&nbsp;blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user. At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. As of writing, they’re on sale at Amazon and Walmart in select colors starting at $479.99 ($70 off), which is their second-best price to date and $30 shy of their all-time low. Keep in mind that you can also occasionally pick up the first-gen model for less than $400, but right now, we’re not seeing any deals of note on the original pair.

    "description": "跟踪 AI 机器人抓取 Web 内容的 TollBit 报告，在 266 个网站中检索增强生成（Retrieval-Augmented Generation 或 RAG）机器人抓取流量已超过了训练机器人的抓取流量，RAG 机器人的抓取量从去年四季度到今年一季度增长了 49%。而这些机器人程序日益无视网站的 robots.txt，一个季度内绕过 robots.txt 的比例从 3.3% 升至 12.9%。RAG 机器人流量的增长反映了用户越来越多的通过聊天机器人如 ChatGPT 而不是 Google 去执行 Web 搜索。TollBit CEO 兼联合创始人 Toshit Panigrahi 表示，这一趋势意味着网站需要重新定位去面向机器人访客而不是人类访客。但对内容出版商而言问题是机器人不会付钱人类则可能会付钱，所以如何获利成为一大难题。AI 公司通常会以合理使用的名义拒绝支付任何费用，它们的 AI 机器人还会无视限制绕过屏蔽。",

    "description": "尽管人类利用望远镜观察太阳已超过四百年，但一直以来我们都只能从地球绕日轨道面上观察太阳，无法看清楚太阳两极的样貌。由 ESA 主导的太阳轨道卫星(SolO)首次传回了太阳的南极影像，独特视角或将改变我们对太阳磁场、太阳活动周期以及太空天气运作方式的理解。过去的太阳探测器不论是环绕地球或是太阳，几乎都是配置在黄道面附近，与太阳赤道面的夹角不会超过7度，使得太阳两极成为观测死角。虽然 ESA 曾与 NASA 合作利用尤利西斯号探测器，以 79 度的绕极轨道观测太阳风与磁场，但并没有搭载任何望远镜与相机，所以太阳两极的活动样貌至今仍没有人见过。ESA 在 2020 年发射太阳轨道卫星(SolO)，除了太阳风与磁场观测仪器之外，还搭载了偏振和日震成像仪（PHI）、极紫外线成像仪（EUI）以及日冕环境光谱成像仪（SPICE），试图用高倾角轨道来捕捉太阳两极的活动影像。",
